An apartment building collapsed on Monday in Magnitogorsk, a city in the Ural region of Russia. A suspected gas leak led to an explosion, followed by the ten-storey building coming down. A total of 39 are confirmed dead, officials told state media, adding that rescuers ended their work yesterday. Some reports suggest a deliberate criminal act.


The 1973 building was home to over 1,000 people; 48 apartments were damaged. Rescuers, working in temperatures well below freezing, according to the emergencies ministry recovered at least ten survivors from the debris on Monday. The building was evacuated. Over 1,000 rescuers responded.


The Investigative Committee and the Federal Security Service (FSB) said they believe gas, which leaks relatively frequently in Russia, was the trigger for the disaster which occurred at 6am as many occupants slept. President Vladimir Putin was briefed, and flew to Magnitogorsk on Monday, observing the rescue mission and visiting the wounded in hospital. In a meeting that day he was told by Emergencies Minister Yevgeny Zinichev of ""presumably between 36 and 40 people under the rubble"", while Chelyabinsk regional Deputy Governor Oleg Klimov indicated 68 people were missing. 


Search and rescue was suspended on Tuesday, with Zinichev describing the ""real threat of [another] part of the building collapsing"" as making it ""impossible to continue working in such conditions"", and work launched to stabilise the remaining structure. He estimated this would take 24 hours. Cranes were used to hoist workers into position to demolish sections deemed dangerous. Rescue work resumed on Wednesday, with additional bodies recovered increasing the confirmed death toll from fourteen to 31.


""The search and rescue operation is complete,"" Deputy Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Chupriyan told TASS on Wednesday. Chelyabinsk's governor has promised each victim will be subject to a payout of one million rubles.


Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova indicated on Monday the chances of those trapped being found alive were already diminishing. On Tuesday an eleven-month-old boy, identified only as Ivan, was rescued alive and flown to Moscow for treatment of injuries including frostbite, leg fractures, and head trauma. He was found under rubble, still in his cot after having been trapped for over 30 hours. Ivan's condition was on Wednesday reported to not be life-threatening.


The Emergencies Ministry said six deaths were of children.


On the night of Monday to Tuesday another explosion hit a gas-powered minibus in the city. Officials said three people died; their identities were not provided. Both explosions took place on Karl Marx Avenue, within two miles of each other.


—Zinichev calling a temporary halt to rescue work ahead of emergency stabilisation works

The FSB denies the two explosions are related; reports describe speculation the disaster's cause was not in fact a gas leak. One news site, Znak.com, claims FSB sources have ascribed the explosion to terrorism. The Investigative Committee says it has found no trace of explosives despite Znak.com claiming an anonymous source described a second-floor apartment being used as an explosives depot ahead of a planned shopping centre bombing. Znak.com further reported its source said that apartment's tenant moved in the day before the blast.


Regional governor Boris Dubrovsky said FSB officers were present where the minibus exploded outside the local administrative building, but said this too was unrelated to the other explosion. Znak.com reported its source said ""three terrorists"" were killed in a firefight on Monday night, while footage from the scene showed the vehicle burn amid what sounds like gunfire.


The website further reported its anonymous source claimed a fourth offender escaped and remains wanted. Monday saw armed police with dogs searching a second apartment block in Magnitigorsk. Residents there told the press the officers claimed to be seeking a bomb.

Nancy Pelosi yesterday resumed the office of Speaker of the House, being voted into the position by the incoming 116th United States Congress.


The new members of the House of Representatives, which include 235 Democrats and 199 Republicans, voted for Pelosi to serve as Speaker with 220 votes.  Republican Kevin McCarthy, who held the post of Speaker this past term, received 192.


""I pledge that this Congress will be transparent, bipartisan and unifying; that we will seek to reach across the aisle in this Chamber and across the divisions across our nation,"" Pelosi told the public.  Guests at the swearing in included Pelosi's grandchildren and such celebrities as fashion designer Tim Gunn and Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart.


President Donald Trump congratulated Pelosi, saying, ""hopefully we're going to have a lot of things that we can get done together.""


Pelosi has said her plans for the new term will begin with less controversial issues with which she could find common ground with Republicans, but Democrats also plan to address the current government shutdown promptly.


About a quarter of the U.S. federal government, 800,000 employees, is not in operation because President Trump and the previous Congress could not reach an agreement about the national budget.  President Trump has said he will not approve a budget that does not allocate funding for a wall along the country's border with Mexico.  Pelosi has proposed legislation that would fund the government through September.  For the budget to pass, it must also be approved by the Senate, which has a Republican majority, and it must be signed by President Trump.


Within her own party, the choice of Pelosi was not uncontested.  Some called for younger leadership. Altogether, fifteen Democrats defected.  Pelosi had agreed to support some of her opponents' plans, such as term limits for individuals serving as Speaker.


The 116th U.S. Congress has the greatest number of women, 102, and people of color in the country's history and also has the youngest average age.


Nancy Pelosi became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House in 2007 and held the post until 2011. The Speaker of the House is the third-highest ranking person in the U.S. Federal government and automatically assumes the presidency if the President and Vice President are both killed or incapacitated.


Unlike Senators, who serve six-year terms, members of the House are elected for two-year terms.  As such, every member of the House is either re-elected or replaced during every federal election.

A fire yesterday afternoon killed five girls, all aged fifteen, at an escape room the group was visiting to celebrate a birthday in Koszalin, North Poland. Following the fire, which also seriously injured a man, authorities are performing checks on all the nation's escape rooms.


Escape rooms see participants locked into a space and given clues and a time limit to figure out how to free themselves. The enterprises have grown in popularity in recent years with reportedly over 1,000 in Poland which are especially patronised by teens.


President Andrzej Duda said the victims were ""joyful girls starting out in life [who] have had life torn away from them"" in an ""appalling tragedy"" while Interior Minister Joachim Brudziński wrote he had ordered fire safety checks on escape rooms across Poland by the State Fire Brigade. He tweeted, ""I want to express my sympathy and regrets to the families of the victims of the fire"". Duda also characterised the deaths as ""crushing"" and wrote ""May God protect their parents and loved ones.""


Tomasz Kubiak, a fire service spokesman, told Agence France-Presse the male victim is in intensive care with ""severe burns"". Police press officer Monika Kosiec stated police believe him to be aged 25. Kosiec revealed police have been unable to question him. State press agency PAP has reported being told off the record all five deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning.


In addition to the inspections Brudzinski also ordered the installation of safety improvements at the facilities. Mayor of Koszalin Piotr Jedlinski has declared tomorrow a day of mourning.

Saturday, January 5, 2019  


A road accident followed by a fire on a Florida highway near Gainesville on Thursday killed five children in a church bus and two truck drivers. One semi truck and a car broke through the center guardrail before colliding with other vehicles; around 50 gallons of diesel fuel, officials said, spilled and ignited.


The children were all from Marksville, Louisiana. The Avoyelles House of Mercy, a Pentecostal church, had been travelling 700 miles from Louisiana to Walt Disney World and was within an hour of its destination. One truck driver was from West Palm Beach, Florida, the other from Albuquerque, New Mexico. 


The deceased were aged nine, ten, thirteen, two aged fourteen, 49, and 59. At least eight more people were hospitalized.


The accident sequence began, Florida Highway Patrol described, in the northbound lanes of Interstate 75 close to Alachua when the initial collision between the car and truck occurred. After crossing the center divider, the out-of-control vehicles collided with the church bus and a second semi truck in the southbound lanes. The bus overturned, with occupants ejected; a southbound fifth vehicle was unable to prevent itself running through the debris. Reports indicate this vehicle may have struck victims lying on the roadway.


According to eyewitness Vinnie DeVita, ""within probably 15 to 20 seconds of it all, it exploded. I mean, just a ball of flames."" DeVita narrowly avoided being caught up in the accident. The Alachua Sheriff's Office tweeted the response ""required all hands on deck."" Authorities stated the road was damaged by the fire's ferocity. Emergency workers have indicated a homicide probe is ongoing.


—Troy Roberts

Another eyewitness, Nicole Towarek, described extensive tire marks and ""insane"" heat. Florida Department of Transportation official Troy Roberts said yesterday morning the road itself, which is straight in the vicinity, will be examined as part of investigations. He said ""Guardrails can only take so much."" The guardrail would be examined, Roberts said, to determine if it had performed as designed. The state had lanes closed last night as it worked to repair the damaged surface.


Also investigating is the Florida Highway Patrol, which is attempting to ascertain who, if anyone, is to blame. Meanwhile the National Transportation Safety Board, commonly involved in major highway accident probes, was absent. It is presently unable to operate due to a shutdown of much of the Federal government in a budget dispute; however, its website notes that its operations center is still accepting accident notifications without specifying if this resource is operating 24/7 as it usually does.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Senator_Ted_Cruz_proposes_amendment_to_U.S._Constitution_setting_Congressional_term_limits,2019-01-06,Senator Ted Cruz proposes amendment to U.S. Constitution setting Congressional term limits,"Sunday, January 6, 2019 


On Thursday, former United States presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz and fellow Republican Representative Francis Rooney proposed to set lifetime limits for service in the Senate and House through amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America.  It was co-sponsored by Senators Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, and David Perdue of Georgia, all Republicans.


Under current U.S. constitutional law, the president is limited to two terms of service but senators and representatives may serve for as many terms as their constituents wish to re-elect them.  Under this proposal, senators would be limited to two terms and representatives to three.


Cruz, in remarks to ABC, said, ""For too long, members of Congress have abused their power and ignored the will of the American people[...] Term limits on members of Congress offer a solution to the brokenness we see in Washington, D.C. It is long past time for Congress to hold itself accountable. I urge my colleagues to submit this constitutional amendment to the states for speedy ratification.""


If passed without measures specifically stipulating otherwise, this would limit Cruz himself to his current term.


Both President Trump and some Democrats, such as former Representative Beto O'Rourke, have expressed favorable interest in Congressional term limits in the past.


In order for this proposal to become a constitutional amendment, both houses of the U.S. Congress would have to pass it by two-thirds majority, and then it would have to be ratified by at least three quarters of the country's 50 state legislatures.


The U.S. Constitution originally did not limit the number of presidential terms, but there was a longstanding tradition of not seeking a third term after the country's first president, George Washington, sought no third term.  Only President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who led the country during the Second World War, served more than two.  The 22nd amendment establishing a legal limit on presidential terms was passed in 1947.

An apartment block caught fire on Saturday morning in Badalona, a Catalonian city around ten kilometres from Barcelona. The blaze killed three, including a 92-year-old woman, and injured sixteen, including a baby.


The fire service indicated on Twitter the baby girl was critically ill, while two adults were seriously injured. Local authorities indicated the most seriously injured adults escaped alive by leaping from windows to flee the ten-storey building. As of yesterday, no cause had yet been released for the fire by authorities in the Mediterranean coastal town.


Firefighters put the fire out on Saturday and were subsequently pictured searching the charred apartments. Windows were broken out on multiple floors, with soot coating the outside of the structure.


A second fire on Saturday, eighteen kilometres away in a another block of flats in La Llagosta, killed another person, according to firefighters.

United States President Donald Trump said on Friday he can and may declare a national state of emergency, which he said would allow him to act without approval from Congress and allocate funding for the construction of a wall along the country's border with Mexico. The US government is currently partially shut down because the president and Congress could not agree on a national budget. The President insists that the budget include funding for the wall, which was one of his campaign promises, but Congress has not passed his proposed budget.


Trump said on Friday ""I can do it [call a national emergency] if I want. I may do it."" Trump also said that he would prefer to agree a solution with the opposition. He also said, ""I never threaten anybody."" He also claimed that the wall was a crucial part of America's border security. The Vice President, Mike Pence, said on Friday the United States is ""in the midst of a crisis on our southern border."" Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, said on Friday ""We are committed to keeping our border safe. We can do that best when government is open. We made that clear to the president.""


The Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, said on Friday ""We made a plea to the president once again: don't hold hundreds of thousands of federal workers hostage"" and ""So we told the president we needed the government open. He resisted.""


Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin and incoming chair of the House Intelligence Committee Represenative Adam Schiff both yesterday questioned the President's power to do as he proposed.  Schiff called it ""a non-starter"".  Durbin said ""I can just tell you, I don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern"".


President Trump claims he would be okay if the impasse over the shutdown went on for ""years."" This lockdown started on December 22, last year. Some museums, the National Zoo, and immigration courts have shut, with some people working in still-open services without pay. The Internal Revenue Service website advises citizens to continue paying their federal taxes. Some services are still open, including medical services Medicare and Medicaid. Federal courts are relying on non-government sources, like court fees, for funding.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Simple_animals_could_live_in_Martian_brines:_Wikinews_interviews_planetary_scientist_Vlada_Stamenkovi%C4%87,2019-01-09,Simple animals could live in Martian brines: Wikinews interviews planetary scientist Vlada Stamenković,"Wednesday, January 9, 2019 


Planetary scientist Vlada Stamenković of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and colleagues have developed a new chemical model of how oxygen dissolves in Martian conditions, which raises the possibility of oxygen-rich brines; enough, the work suggests, to support simple animals such as sponges. The model was published in Nature on October 22. Wikinews caught up with him in an email interview to find out more about his team's research and their plans for the future.


The atmosphere of Mars  is far too thin for humans to breathe or for lungs like ours to extract any oxygen at all. It has on average only around 0.6% of the pressure of Earth's atmosphere, and this is mainly carbon dioxide; only 0.145% of the thin Martian atmosphere is oxygen. The new model indicated these minute traces of oxygen should be able to enter salty seeps of water on or near the planet's surface at levels high enough to support life forms comparable to Earth's microbes, possibly even simple sponges.  Some life forms can survive without oxygen, but oxygen permits more energy-intensive metabolism. Almost all complex multicellular life on Earth depends on oxygen.


""We were absolutely flabbergasted [...] I went back to recalculate everything like five different times to make sure it's a real thing,"" Stamenković told National Geographic.


""Our work is calling for a complete revision for how we think about the potential for life on Mars, and the work oxygen can do,"" he told Scientific American, ""implying that if life ever existed on Mars it might have been breathing oxygen"".


 Stamenković et al cite research from 2014 showing some simple sponges can survive with only 0.002 moles of oxygen per cubic meter (0.064 mg per liter). Some microbes that need oxygen can survive with as little as a millionth of a mole per cubic meter (0.000032 mg per liter). In their model, they found there can be enough oxygen for microbes throughout Mars, and enough for simple sponges in oases near the poles.


In 2014, also suggesting multicellular life could exist on Mars, de Vera et al, using the facilities at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), studied some lichens, including Pleopsidium chlorophanum, which can grow high up in Antarctic mountain ranges. They showed those lichens can also survive and even grow in Mars simulation chambers. The lichens can do this because their algal component is able to produce the oxygen needed by the fungal component. Stamenković et al's research provides a way for oxygen to get into the Martian brines without algae or photosynthesis.


Stamenković et al found oxygen levels throughout Mars would be high enough for the least demanding aerobic (oxygen-using) microbes, for all the brines they considered, and all the methods of calculation. They published a detailed map[3] of the distributions of solubility for calcium perchlorates for their more optimistic calculations, which they reckoned were closer to the true case, with and without supercooling. The lowest concentrations were shown in the tropical southern uplands. Brine in regions poleward of about 67.5° to the north and about 72.5° to the south could have oxygen concentrations high enough for simple sponges. Closer to the poles, concentrations could go higher, approaching levels typical of sea water on Earth, 0.2 moles per cubic meter (6.4 mg per liter), for calcium perchlorates. On Earth, worms and clams that live in the muddy sea beds require 1 mg per liter, bottom feeders such as crabs and oysters 3 mg per liter, and spawning migratory fish 6 mg per liter, all within 0.2 moles per cubic meter, 6.4 mg per liter.


Stamenković et al studied magnesium and calcium perchlorates, common on Mars. They found the highest oxygen concentrations occur when the water is colder, which happens most in polar regions.


Stamenković et al's paper is theoretical and is based on a simplified general circulation model of the Mars atmosphere — it ignores distinctions of seasons and the day / night cycle. Stamenković's team combined it with a chemical model of how oxygen would dissolve in the brines and used this to predict oxygen levels in such brines at various locations on Mars. 


When asked about plans for a future model that might include seasonal timescales, Stamenković told Wikinews, ""Yes, we are now exploring the kinetics part and want to see what happens on shorter timescales.""


Stamenković et al's model also takes account of the tilt of the Mars axis, which varies much more than Earth's does.  


Wikinews asked Stamenković if he had any ideas about whether and how sponges could survive through times when the tilt was higher and less oxygen would be available:


Wikinews also asked Stamenković how their research is linked to the recent discovery of possible large subglacial lake below the Martian South Pole found through radar mapping.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Wikinews_investigates_disappearance_of_Indonesian_cargo_ship_Namse_Bangdzod,2019-01-10,Wikinews investigates disappearance of Indonesian cargo ship Namse Bangdzod,"Thursday, January 10, 2019 


In late December, Indonesian cargo ship MV Namse Bangdzod vanished in local waters. The tanker, gross tonnage around 1,150 and loaded with crude palm oil, had over ten crewmembers. Wikinews examined data and contacted experts and local authorities in an effort to establish further details.


The exact date of disappearance is unclear, with industry publications reporting either December 27 or December 28. Crew totals are also unclear, with both eleven and twelve reported by industry sources while The Jakarta Post reports a captain and eleven other crew. Wikinews has contacted the Command and Control Centre of the Coast Guard seeking to clarify, among other things, the date of the disappearance and is awaiting a response.


Wikinews is also awaiting responses from both the Coast Guard and the National Search and Rescue Agency detailing the efforts being made to find the ship, which was last known to be in the Java Sea. MV Namse Bangdzod sailed with cargo from Sampit, a port town on a river in Borneo; it was last bound for Jakarta. It is owned and operated by Indonesian companies and also registered in Indonesia. The 75 m (250 ft) ship was built in 1993 in Japan.


Ships broadcast their position and other information via both the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and the Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) system. AIS is a ship-to-ship safety system, but can also be detected from further afield by satellites. Marine Traffic's AIS tracking database shows a reestablishment of AIS contact by MV Namse Bangdzod on January 6, with a pattern described by Marine Bulletin as ""rather hectic and kind of confused"". In addition to asking local authorities, Wikinews sought expert input on the AIS data.


Dr. Tristan Smith of University College London, a shipping researcher with expert experience interpreting AIS results, explained to Wikinews that crews might turn their AIS transponders off on purpose for security reasons, such as ""in certain sea areas where piracy is a risk"" in order to ""avoid attracting unwanted attention. This can involve them being turned off for several days at a time."" Doug Miller of Milltech Marine, a firm specialising in AIS, told our correspondent an AIS transponder will broadcast automatically provided it has power and antennae, even if the crew abandoned the vessel. 


Baslan Damang, a security official from the port of departure, on Tuesday told The Jakarta Post radio broadcasts were being used to alert other traffic such as fishing vessels to look out for MV Namse Bangdzod. He added authorities ""are still waiting for updates on the tanker's condition, so please refrain from speculating that it had been hijacked"". As of yesterday, no oil slicks or other evidence of accidents have been found along the scheduled route the vessel was due to take. A major search continues.


Miller and Smith both acknowledged faults with the AIS system on-board as possible explanations, with Miller describing issues with the signal between the transponder and the satellite receiving it as one potential scenario for intermittent data reception. He too suggested a hypothetical scenario, in which ""the AIS equipment has been tampered with or has been turned off for some of the time — either intentionally or accidentally or due to a power malfunction."" Smith called the disappearance an ""interesting"" case; Miller said ""It is a little hard to definitively say what's going on"". Miller explained that while transponders generally transmit every ten seconds ""even if the transponder is transmitting there is no guarantee that other vessels or MarineTraffic can see it"". ""It could also be a power supply issue or faulty transponder"", said Smith.


Smith told Wikinews ""There are also some operations done on ships containing hazardous cargoes[...] where all risks of sparking/arcs need to be removed and radio transmitting equipment is sometimes turned off for this reason."" He said this applied to product tankers, but the long duration of AIS downtime would in this instance be unusual if this is the reason. Smith had one more theory: Namse Bangdzod could be the victim of identity theft, with a second vessel conducting manoeuvres it wished to conceal while falsely transmitting information identifying itself as Namse Bangdzod. Smith told Wikinews this might happen in cases of illegal fishing. He stated ""In this scenario, it would normally be expected that both the legal and illegal transmission would be received but depending on how Marine Traffic handle this, it's possible the two signals could be confused.""


Smith drew attention to LRIT as another method for search and rescue personnel to find the tanker. Unlike AIS, which is a safety and tracking system, LRIT is used for maritime security by seagoing nations. Created under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization, LRIT allows states to examine data about ships bearing their flag, visiting their ports, or in or near their waters. 


Like all vessels exceeding 300 tons, Namse Bangdzod is required to transmit LRIT data. Search and rescue bodies can also access this information; Smith told Wikinews he believed this would include foreign navies with ships in the Java Sea. Singapore, India, and Australia have in the past conducted emergency searches of the Java Sea: All three nations offered military assistance after Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 vanished in December 2014.


Marine Traffic's website's most recently publicly available AIS result, as of Tuesday, showed the ship underway a few miles off Jakarta. VesselFinder listed no AIS results for the last month. Vessel Tracker's database had no sighting of the ship within the last 59 days on Tuesday; the website noted the AIS signal received from Jakarta but declared the ship was not actually there. Maritime Connector has an entry for the ship in its database but has no location data available.


Local authorities, according to Maritime Bulletin, have noted other unusual AIS data. The website yesterday  suggested piracy, perhaps to obtain the valuable cargo, is now the most prominent theory. The Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association reports a value of US$473.60 per metric ton of crude palm oil as of November 2018, with the price decreasing that month. ""Its plausible that an explanation [why] the AIS transponder is not transmitting is that it had been turned off by pirates who wanted to hamper the efforts of a rescue mission"" Smith told Wikinews yesterday.


Yesterday the Search and Rescue Agency told The Jakarta Post it was intending to end its search on the basis of piracy, which is outside its remit; the paper also spoke to the Navy, who told it this was as-yet uncomfirmed and noted no ransom has been sought and the ship vanished from an area without previous piracy problems. Four Navy ships assisted by aircraft are searching. ""We will continue searching until we find it,"" 1st Fleet Command's Navy Information Agency head Arba Agung told The Jakarta Post, which also today reported location data falsely showing the ship in Sunda Kelapa Port after its inaccurate position in Jakarta Bay was recorded.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Scientists_report_correlation_between_locations_of_Easter_Island_statues_and_water_resources,2019-01-12,Scientists report correlation between locations of Easter Island statues and water resources,"Saturday, January 12, 2019 


A United-States-based team of scientists released findings on Thursday about the large statues that dot the island of Rapa Nui, also called Easter Island. The study, published on Thursday in PLOS One, employed quantitative spatial analysis to establish that the platforms, or ahu, built to support the Easter Island statues, or moai, are usually located near sources of drinkable water.  This feeds into the scholarly discussion of whether the purpose of the statues was exclusively ritualistic, practical or some combination of these.


The study examined 93 statues on the western side of the island, all of which were built before contact with Europeans.  They compared the sites of the statues to sites associated with the specific resources: the kind of rock the statues are made of, the kind of rock used for tools, fishing, vegetable and potato cultivation, and water sources.  The archaeologists say that this study is the first attempt to formally examine the idea that the locations of the moai are correlated to locations of resources important to the people who built them, such as fresh water.


Easter Island does not have streams that run nonstop but it does have an aquifer that produces freshwater seeps of brackish but drinkable water during low tide. Most of these water harvesting sites are along the coast but a few are inland—and so are the ahu.


""What is important about it is that it demonstrates the statue locations themselves are not a weird ritual place – [the ahu and moai] represent ritual in a sense of there is symbolic meaning to them, but they are integrated into the lives of the community,"" said study co-author Professor Carl Lipo of Binghamton University. He went on to add ""The exceptions to the rule about being at the coast where water comes out actually are met by the fact there is also water there – it is found through cave locations,"" referring to caves with fresh water, and that some historical evidence suggests there may have been wells dug near the ahu that are not near caves.


The researchers plan to gather information on more freshwater resources so they can evaluate statue sites on the rest of Easter Island.  


Jo Anne Val Tilburg of the University of California, Los Angeles disagreed with these findings: ""The existence of fresh water seeps near coastal ahu is well-known and was certainly important at European contact. However, such seeps are today, and probably always were, minor resources. It is highly unlikely, in my view, that these resources were of major importance in locating ahu during prehistory.""


The earliest moai date to the 13th century. They vary in size but are about fourteen feet (four meters) tall and can weigh about fourteen tons.  Scholars have long wondered about the role they played for the people who built them.


Easter Island is today a relatively barren place with scanty resources. Easter Island is located 2300 miles (3700 km) off the west coast of South America and 1,100 miles (1770 km) from its nearest neighbor island. It today has a grass-dominated landscape but it was once mostly covered by palm forests and it was home to a significant human population for a few hundred years.  Scientists debate whether its environmental degradation, in the form of the loss of its palm forests and soil to erosion, was caused by human activity, natural climate change, or by rats and other introduced species that stowed away on the colonists' boats, but there is consensus that the island's environment changed considerably over time.

A bus operated by Viazul, which is run by the Cuban military's tourist section, crashed on Thursday between Baracoa and Guantanamo. It was carrying a mix of locals and foreigners from Baracoa to Havana. The crash reportedly killed seven.


The bus overturned in wet conditions; the bus driver told reporters he lost control, with some local press claiming he was attempting to pass another vehicle. The front-left section of the vehicle was heavily damaged in the rollover. At least one seat was pictured lying beside the wreck. According to reports, of the 40 passengers, 22 were Cuban. 


Foreign nationals were from France, Mexico, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Four of the deceased were from overseas; they were two Argentinians, one from France, and a fourth from Germany.


The crash took place on a bendy road at around 15:00 local time. Cuban roads suffer a large number of accidents; 2018 saw 11,187 recorded accidents leading to 750 deaths and 7,999 injuries. Sky News said Thursday's accident was the fourth major bus crash in a month. In addition to the deaths, 33 were reported hopitalised with five seriously injured.

Adamowicz was an early supporter of democracy, and has been mayor since 1998.


Ex-Prime Minister Donald Tusk, the current President of the European Council, wrote ""Let's all pray for Mayor Adamowicz. Paweł, we are with you."" Tusk, a founding Civic Platform member, is from Gdańsk. Interior Minister Joachim Brudziński called the stabbing ""an act of inexplicable barbarity."" He said ""I can’t find the words, an explanation, for this kind of act. Especially since the finale of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity has for the last 27 years always been associated with good, with something joyful, positive."" 


The fundraiser was intending this year to obtain money for children's hospitals to buy equipment. It raises money annually to assist the nation's medical services.


Brudziński said Adamowicz required resuscitation, and was in a ""serious"" condition; TVN24 reported he received surgery. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki tweeted ""We are with Mayor Adamowicz in our thoughts and prayers."" President Andrzej Duda remarked, ""Today I am unconditionally with him and his loved ones, just as I hope all of us compatriots are. I pray for his return to health and full strength.""


Duda told local media Adamowicz's heart was restarted by doctors ""and there is hope, but his condition is very difficult."" Police spokesman Mariusz Ciarka said a press badge was used by the assailant, reported by The Guardian as convicted of assaults and by Associated Press of bank robberies, to gain entry. The detained suspect's identity is restricted to 'Stefan W' owing to Polish privacy legislation.


Adamowicz was taken to the Medical University of Gdańsk, where Dr. Tomasz Stefaniak was met with applause early today upon announcing to journalists Adamowicz remained alive. ""The next hours will decide everything,"" Stefaniak said. Politicians and the Archbishop of Gdańsk, Sławoj Leszek Głódź, were reported by local media to have visited the hospital while Adamowicz received emergency surgery.


Adamowicz subsequently was announced to have died. Health Minister Łukasz Szumowski said ""We couldn’t win,"" and the city flag is at half-mast. Gdańsk residents donated blood by the hundreds today in a bid to assist. Vigils nationwide this evening were attended by thousands.


Adamowicz, 53, has supported LGBT rights and and the inclusion of minority groups. He recently condemned anti-semitism after vandalism against a synagogue in the city. Adamowicz was at the event after collecting money for the organisation in Gdańsk's streets alongside volunteers nationwide.


A potential charge of murder against Stefan W carries a possible life sentence. Prosecutor Krzysztof Sierak told reporters today psychiatric assessments will be carried out to confirm if Stefan W is fit for trial.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Iranian_cargo_plane_crashes_into_Karaj_houses,2019-01-15,Iranian cargo plane crashes into Karaj houses,"Tuesday, January 15, 2019 





A Boeing 707 cargo plane, reported by local press as belonging to the Iranian military, crashed into houses in Karaj, near Tehran, the Iranian capital, yesterday. All but one of the sixteen on-board died; no deaths were reported on the ground, with local media reporting no-one was in the houses.


The aircraft came down into a residential area between Fath Airport, where it was attempting to land, and Payam International Airport. Fath Airport is owned by the Revolutionary Guards. State media reported the cockpit voice recorder was recovered. The army said the plane was bringing meat from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan ""to help the country's economy.""


Fars News said the crash involved pilot error. The lone survivor was a flight engineer. The entire crew were Iranians, the army said. Press TV said the crash was followed by a fire. Photographs showed the aircraft, sans wings, with the cockpit buried within a house and twisted engine parts strewn around.


The Aviation Herald reported the failed landing at Fath, which has a much shorter runway than Payam, was a mistake and the jet was supposed to land at Payam. The industry publication stated the aircraft overran the runway and broke through a perimeter barrier. It cited the Air Force as stating Saha Airlines owned the plane, and claimed a reported sixteenth death. 


In 2018 another aircraft confused the two airports, performing an emergency go around at ""very low height"" according to The Aviation Herald.


The Centre for Aviation's database of air carriers lists Saha as belonging to the Air Force and states it runs flights with Boeing 707s and Airbus A300s, but uses Boeing 747s for freight. Airfleets, a database detailing the aircraft operated by commercial carriers, states the aircraft uses the A300 and 747 as well as the Boeing 737. It does not, however, list any 707s. The Aviation Herald states the 707 was a freighter, despite photos showing a row of windows along each side; it lists a tail number of EP-CPP. 


Wikinews contacted Boeing in an effort to establish the plane's initial configuration when manufactured. Boeing did not release any specific information about the initial build, telling Wikinews the company ""extends its profound condolences to the families and friends of those lost[...] as well as our best wishes for the recovery of those injured."" Boeing referred to the 707 involved as a ""cargo plane"".


Iran's air fleet is ageing, with sanctions restricting the purchase of both new planes and parts to maintain those already owned.

The National Transportation Safety Committee of Indonesia on Monday announced the cockpit voice recorder from Lion Air Flight 610 has been recovered from the Java Sea. All 189 on the aircraft died when the flight came down last October.


The device was located and recovered ""broken into two pieces"" from under eight metres (about 25 feet) of mud, according to investigators. The new Boeing 737 Max was not airworthy, investigators have said, and should not have taken off. It was commencing a journey from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang and hit the ocean at speed shortly after asking air traffic control to return. It disintegrated upon impact.


The location of the device, and the location of the flight data recorder recovered in November, were around 50 m (165 ft) apart. Authorities said they found human remains nearby the second recorder.


Lion Air has been funding extended searches for both the recorder and outstanding human remains. The aircraft had been operating for days with a malfunctioning airspeed indicator; its angle of attack sensor had recently been replaced. Preliminary investigations suggest a new feature on the 737 Max, which had not suffered a crash before, was forcing the nose down in an erroneous attempt to prevent an aerodynamic stall, while the pilots tried and failed to correct this.

Former United States Central Intelligence Agency agent Tony Mendez died Saturday, aged 78, at a Frederick, Maryland assisted living facility.  Mendez is known for organizing the safe return in 1980 of several U.S. nationals who had hidden in the Canadian embassy during the Iran Hostage Crisis.


Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell praised Mendez on Twitter: ""Tony was one of the best officers to ever serve at CIA. His work was unique, and it help to protect our nation in significant ways. He will be missed. May he Rest In Peace.""


Mendez once told The Washington Post he considered himself ""an artist first.""  He worked as a draftsman before applying for a graphic artist job in 1965 that turned out to be at the CIA.  Mendez spent most of his 25-year career at posts outside the U.S., many in Asia.  He specialized in removing people from areas that had become dangerous for them, a process called ""exfiltration."" He studied Hollywood makeup and special effects for use in his work, later titling his memoir The Master of Disguise.


Mendez's wife Jonna Mendez, also CIA, said, ""He could be Pakistani, he could be Mexican, he could be from a lot of different countries[...] It was incredible to work with my husband.""


In 1979, revolutionaries took control of Iran and captured the U.S. embassy, taking dozens of people there hostage. They would be held for 444 days.  Six other U.S. diplomats fled to the Canadian embassy and hid until Mendez and another agent successfully smuggled them out of the country disguised as a Canadian film crew working on a supposed movie called Argo.  The events were nicknamed ""the Canadian Caper"" and later made into an Academy Award-winning film of the same name — Argo — in 2012, with Ben Affleck directing and playing Mendez.


For his work, Mendez was awarded the Intelligence Star by then-U.S.-president Jimmy Carter, though the CIA's involvement in the Argo rescue remained a secret until 1997.


Affleck tweeted, ""Tony Mendez was a true American hero. He was a man of extraordinary grace, decency, humility and kindness. He never sought the spotlight for his actions, he merely sought to serve his country. I'm so proud to have worked for him and to have told one of his stories.""


According to his publicist, Mendez died of Parkinson's disease.  He is survived by his wife, Jonna, three children from two marriages, two grandchildren, and his sisters.  Another son has predeceased him. He has authored three books, one with his wife.  A fourth, also co-written with Jonna Mendez, is due out in May.

Germany on Monday banned Iranian airline Mahan Air from flying in the European nation, with officials saying this is for security reasons.


Mahan has been the subject of United States sanctions since 2011. ""The airline transports weapons and fighters across the Middle East, supporting the Iranian regime's destructive ambitions around the region,"" according to a tweet on Monday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The US has been encouraging allies such as Germany to restrict Mahan's operations. The Federal Aviation Office of Germany has suspended Mahan's permit, German officials said.


Rudaw reports Mahan's director, Hamid Arabnejad Khanooki, has alleged ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran. The airline is privately owned. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, said it is possible ""that this airline carries out transports to Germany that affect our security concerns,"" and the ban followed discussions within Europe and with the US. US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell alleged, by way of example, Mahan had ""contributed to incredible human suffering, violence, and political instability felt across the world,"" by supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.


The United States government claims Mahan flies fighters and cargo to Syria in support of al-Assad. The airline was Iran's first in private hands.  It has Iran's largest fleet, and is still operating in Europe with destinations including Spain, Greece, France, and Italy. It was founded in 1992.


The move comes after the European Union sanctioned Iran earlier in the month over alleged Revolutionary Guards assassination plots against dissidents in nations including Denmark, France, and the Netherlands. With the US encouraging commercial entities to cease trading in Iran, German firms including Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche Telekom, Daimler, and Siemens have announced plans to pull out of the Middle Eastern nation.


Last year US President Donald Trump withdrew the US from a nuclear nonproliferation treaty with Iran, which had been agreed under former US President Barack Obama. Other signatories to the treaty include Germany, which has been taking a lead in efforts by the remaining signatories to keep the deal operational. Reuters reported on Monday a German government source, whom they did not name, said the ban on Mahan Air is not part of any broader plan to increase sanctions on Iran.

A car bomb was on Monday rammed into a military base in Maidan Shahr in the centre of Afghanistan's Maidan Wardak province. Dozens died in the attack, reportedly conducted by the Taliban. 


The training centre belongs to the National Directorate for Security; it was targeted with a captured Humvee military car packed with explosives, followed by two gunmen. Some estimated death tolls, provided anonymously by officials to journalists, exceeded 100. Sharif Hotak, of the Maidan Wardak provincial council, described witnessing 35 bodies in one hospital, with some casualties, both alive and dead, transported to Kabul. ""The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed,"" he said.


Hotak also alleged the central government are ""hiding accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in morale of the Afghan forces"", whose US-built armoured vehicle was used to breach the compound's defences. A source within the central Interior Ministry reportedly said ""I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts[.]""


The Taliban have claimed responsibility. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid claimed 190 were dead. Efforts are ongoing to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict within the nation, in which the Taliban, once the governing force, seeks to retake control and reimpose their version of Sharia law.  Reuters reported Monday's attack the deadliest since an assault in Ghazni in August 2018, with officials reporting at the time 150 security forces, 95 civilians, and hundreds of Taliban killed.


Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesperson for the provincial governor, said the attack had killed twelve and injured twelve more.


The Taliban met on Monday with Zalmay Khalilzad, a US peace envoy, in Qatar. Last week a Kabul car bombing killed five and wounded 110, another attack ascribed to the Taliban. The civil war has been ongoing for seventeen years; the Taliban wants foreign forces to leave and the Afghan government shut out of peace talks.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/US_study_finds_correlation_between_youth_suicide,_household_gun_ownership",2019-01-26,"US study finds correlation between youth suicide, household gun ownership","Saturday, January 26, 2019 


Professor Michael Siegel of Boston University, co-author of a new study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine on January 17, declared household gun ownership rates within the United States to be ""the strongest single predictor of a state's youth suicide rate"". Wikinews interviewed Siegel to learn more.


Siegel and colleagues including predoctoral fellow Anita Knopov, the lead author, compared data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2004, when the body last surveyed US gun owners, to corresponding information on suicides by 10–19 year olds from 2005 through 2015. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System was used to find data on such variables as education, depression, and suicidal planning and ideation.


The study reports ""For each 10 percentage-point increase in household gun ownership, the youth suicide rate increased by 26.9 percent"". The ten states with highest youth suicide rates had household gun ownership rates above 50%; the ten with the lowest youth suicide rates had household gun ownership around 20%. The data were, the study says, more closely correlated than youth suicide attempts were to actual suicides.


The study notes the National Violent Injury Statistic System indicates 82% of youth suicides involving a gun used one from the victim's own household in 2016. Most variables appeared uncorrelated, with only suicide attempts and proportion of Native American youth showing correlation. The team wrote that guns ""are 2.6 times more lethal than any other means of suicide; thus, access to firearms might be expected to contribute to a higher incidence of suicide."" 


The highest rate noted by the team was in Alaska, with fifteen youth suicides per 100,000 individuals. New Jersey had the lowest rate, which was three per 100,000 people. There were states that did not match the overall trend: Alabama and Mississippi had low youth suicide rates of around 4.5 per 100,000 people but high household gun ownership rates of over 50%. Each state has a large proportion of African-American residents; they were found statistically less likely to commit suicide and to own guns.


Siegel agreed to answer some questions for Wikinews‍'s correspondent.


((Wikinews))  Thank you for taking the time to speak with us. Would you mind telling us a little about yourself, your background, and what led you to look into this subject?


Michael Siegel I am a professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health. My research has focused on the areas of tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. We decided to look at this subject because although there have been some studies that reported an association between household gun ownership and youth suicide rates, one could argue that the reason for this association is that gun households differ systematically from non-gun households in that they are more likely to have youth with depression and therefore youth who are more likely to attempt suicide. Our study was designed to control for these factors in order to determine whether differences in suicide attempt rates explain the observed association between household gun ownership and youth suicide rates.


((WN))  Given that some key data is from 2004, how well do you think your results can be applied to the situation today?


MS Although we used gun ownership data from 2004 for the primary analysis, we repeated the analysis using a household gun ownership proxy averaged over the years 2005–2015, and the results were similar. Thus, we do not believe that there is any reason to think that the results do not apply to the situation today.


((WN))  To what extent do the results of this study match up to your expectations?


MS We did not actually have a pre-conceived idea of whether or not we would find an association after controlling for the proportion of youth who were depressed, had made a suicide plan, or had attempted suicide. We were surprised, however, to find that the percentage of households with a gun was a stronger predictor of the youth suicide rate than the percentage of youth who made a suicide attempt.


((WN))  What influence would you like to see these results having on policymakers?


MS The results suggest that decreasing the access of youth to firearms may lower youth suicide rates. Thus, our findings support efforts to encourage gun owners to store their guns in a manner that prevents youth from accessing them. Policy makers should consider enacting policies that reduce youth access to improperly stored firearms.


((WN))  If you had access to more recent data than that from 2004, what would you hypothesize the difference might be, if any?


MS We don't hypothesize that there would be any substantial difference because when we used the proxy data on gun ownership from 2005–2015, we did not find any major difference in the results. 


—Professor Siegel

((WN))  Did you notice any significant trends in the data year-by-year, and, if so, what were they and what do you think might account for them?


MS In this article, we did not examine trends by year. The study was cross-sectional and combined (averaged) data from 2005 through 2015. Thus, we are not able in this study to examine trends in suicide rates over time.


((WN))  You noted suicide attempts by youth were not as accurate a prediction method for youth suicide rates as the household gun ownership rates were. Why do you think that might be?


MS Our hypothesis is that the most important predictor of the youth suicide rate in a state is the extent to which youth in that state have access to the most lethal means (i.e., firearms). Having a high level of access to firearms, which is the most lethal means for suicide, apparently has a far greater impact on suicide rates and can negate the fact that a state has a low rate of youth suicide attempts (and vice versa).


((WN))  Moving forward from this study, what are the next steps you have planned to research this further?


MS The next step of this research is to examine whether there are particular state firearm laws that impact rates of youth suicide at the state level.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Male_Magellanic_penguins_pine_for_pairings:_Wikinews_interviews_biologist_Natasha_Gownaris,2019-01-27,Male Magellanic penguins pine for pairings: Wikinews interviews biologist Natasha Gownaris,"Sunday, January 27, 2019 


In findings published earlier this month in Ecological Applications, scientists from the University of Washington and Center for Ecosystem Sentinels examine the reason for the plummeting numbers of female Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus, that have been reported at the birds' breeding sites in South America over the past twenty years and more. Wikinews caught up with postdoctoral researcher and study co-author Natasha Gownaris to learn more.


In a press release, Gownaris said, ""Two decades ago, there were about 1.5 adult male Magellanic penguins for every adult female at Punta Tombo[...] Today, it's approaching three males for every female."" The findings suggested a disparity in the death rate of juvenile and adult penguins, rather than differences in chick survival, account for this difference. 


Punta Tombo is one of the annual breeding sites for the species; it is in Argentina. The penguins travel thousands of miles each year to reach these sites.


The work involved building population models out of over thirty years of data collected by tagging individual penguins.  Findings also suggested the pronounced sex disparity might make population models used to predict survival among other birds with a more even gender balance inappropriate for use on Megallanic penguins.


According to the data, since 1987, overall population of Magellanic penguins in Punta Tombo at one of their annual breeding sites in Argentina has declined 40%, while the male-to-female ratio has greatly increased.


Since 1983, the research team has been putting stainless steel bands on tens of thousands of chicks hatched at the Punta Tombo breeding site in Argentina, noting which juvenile and adult birds make it back to the site the next year and extrapolating how many lived and died.  Among juveniles, there was a 17% survival rate for males and 12% for females.  Among adults, it was 89% and 85%.  These effects became compounded every year, reaching as high as six males to one female among older penguins.


The researchers noted implications for penguin conservation: Gownaris remarked, ""Over the years, this team has helped preserve the land and waters around breeding colonies like Punta Tombo[...] But now we're starting to understand that, to help Magellanic penguins, you have to protect waters where they feed in winter, which are thousands of miles north from Punta Tombo.""


Gownaris answered a series of questions for our correspondent.


((Wikinews))  What prompted your curiosity about Magellanic penguins? 


Natasha Gownaris: I've wanted to be a marine scientist since I was a child, when I would collect sand crabs (Emerita talpoida) from local beaches in New York. I studied fish as a graduate student, but I have a pair of adopted parrots and I am generally fascinated by birds. Plus, penguins eat fish! Studying penguins seemed like a great way to merge my love for the ocean and my love for birds. Penguins and other seabirds are also important to study because they tell us something about the health of the ocean ecosystems they feed in, similar to the use of canaries to test air quality in coal mines. Unfortunately, the decline of many seabird species worldwide is yet another warning sign of the negative and widespread impacts humans are having on the ocean.


((WN))  How did you approach putting together such a large-scale study?


NG: This study started in 1982, long before my joining the lab in March of 2016. Dr. Dee Boersma began this study as a response to a Japanese company's interest in harvesting penguins for their skin, meat, and oil. Although the project has evolved over time, Dr. Boersma had the foresight to start banding chicks in 1983 and to set up a standard protocol that we follow each year. Since then, over 44,000 chicks have been banded at Punta Tombo. We’ve been able to follow some individuals for 30+ years, collecting detailed information on things like how often they breed and how many mates they've had. 


((WN))  How much time did you end up spending in Argentina? What was it like at the breeding site?


NG: Members of the Boersma lab and volunteers spend approximately six months each year at Punta Tombo. I was fortunate enough to spend nearly four months at the colony between 2015 and 2017. It's an incredible, otherworldly place. Magellanic penguins nest in burrows or bushes, and some areas of the colony are so dense with burrows that you feel like you're on a different planet. The colony has declined by over 40% since the study started...so I can't even imagine what it was like in the 1980s. My favorite time of the day is around 8PM, when (hopefully fat) penguins are returning to the colony en masse after a foraging trip. They are also most vocal in the morning and evening, making their characteristic braying sound— the related African penguin earned the name ""jackass penguin"" because they sound a bit like donkeys. The colony is also full of other beautiful and interesting creatures, including a llama-like species called the guanaco and an ostrich-like species called the rhea.


—Natasha Gownaris

((WN))  Do you have any theories on why more female juveniles die at sea? You mention starvation; what might be the causes of that, and are there other possible explanations you can think of?


NG: We are not yet certain why females are more likely to die, but we think it must be related to their smaller body size. Because the mortality is most uneven in juveniles, higher mortality doesn’t seem to be related to greater costs of breeding for females than for males. Female Magellanic penguins are about 17% lighter than males and have smaller bills. We think that, because of this size difference, females have a lower storage capacity, can't dive as deep, and can't take as wide a range of prey as males — all disadvantages when faced with limited and unpredictable food resources. These disadvantages hit juvenile females even harder, as juveniles are still learning how to forage and often travel further than adults do in the non-breeding season. Counts of carcasses in the species' migration range support starvation as the main cause of female-biased mortality; while oiled carcasses have a sex ratio of 1:1, females outnumber males in carcasses of starved birds. The only other possibility is that females are moving to other colonies at higher rates than are males, but this species is known to almost always return to its natal colony to breed.


((WN))  You suggest conservation efforts should look at protection of feeding grounds. What sort of measures do you think might be beneficial?


NG: Because penguins migrate such long distances over the non-breeding season, a mixture of tools (including no-take marine protected areas and traditional fisheries management tools, like catch limits) is likely to be needed. Although there is currently some spatial protection surrounding the species’ breeding colony, this protection does not extend to their migratory route. And, of course, everyone can contribute to penguin conservation by reducing their plastic waste, making more sustainable food choices, and reducing their carbon footprint.


((WN))  What do you think might be causing pressure on food sources for the penguins?


NG: The two main threats to the food sources of this colony are climate change, which cause shifts in primary productivity and fish stocks, and fisheries. Fisheries compete with penguins for fish species such as hake and anchovy.


((WN))  Have you noticed differences in behavior among the penguins as the ratios become increasingly skewed?


NG: In a separate study currently under review, we have shown that aggression between males of Magellanic penguins is higher when the sex ratio at the colony is more skewed towards males. We also showed that nearly all females at the colony breed but that, over time, fewer and fewer males find mates. Single male penguins sometimes intrude [on] nests of mated pairs and interrupt the incubation of eggs or feeding of chicks, leading to mortality. In some cases, they will even attack and kill chicks. 


((WN))  Your release mentioned sexing the penguins was problematic; how did you achieve it with confidence?


NG: We have some methods of sexing penguins that we feel confident about — using genetics or measures of cloaca size around egg laying, for example. However, these methods are time intensive, so we have also developed visual cues for sex penguins (bill size, behavior, forehead shape). We looked at individuals that had been sexed using both a certain method (e.g. genetics) and visual methods to calculate how often we got it right based on visual cues alone and found that we have very high accuracy. We also used statistical tools to help to deal with uncertainty in the sex of some individuals. 


((WN))  How well can you extrapolate population trends at Punta Tombo based on the birds you tagged? More broadly, how well do you think this work represents global populations?


—Natasha Gownaris

NG: It is likely that females have higher mortality than males at other colonies of this species and in other penguin species. We unfortunately do not have enough information from other colonies of this species (e.g. sex ratio and population trends) for an accurate global assessment of population trends. We do know that some colonies of the species are growing but that, at the global level, the species is still in decline.


((WN))  In your opinion, for how much longer are penguin populations sustainable without intervention?


NG: This is nearly impossible to answer without more information on other colonies of the species, but the Punta Tombo colony is declining rapidly. We estimate declines of at least 43% since 1987 from our annual surveys at the colony, but it is likely that actual declines are higher because of the increasingly skewed sex ratio.


((WN))  What are your next plans moving forward with your work?


NG: We are currently studying the sex ratio in Magellanic penguin chicks (at hatching and at fledging) to determine how this influences the sex ratio in adults. There are two priorities moving forward — 1) estimating sex ratio at other colonies of this species and determining whether females are more likely to leave Punta Tombo for other colonies than are males and 2) determining the mechanisms underlying lower female survival, e.g. by studying the foraging behavior and diet of males and females and the individual characteristics (like body size) that correlate with survival.

Twin bombings yesterday struck the Jolo Cathedral in Mindanao, Philippines. The second blast affected first responders following the first; between the two blasts, at least 20 were killed.


According to Chief Superintendent Graciano Mijares of the police of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, the confirmed deaths are fourteen civilians, five Armed Forces personnel, and one member of the Coast Guard. This revised downwards an earlier toll of 27 dead. Mijares further claimed 90 civilians were wounded, as were seventeen from the Armed Forces, and two each from the Coast Guard and the National Police. Some victims were airlifted to nearby Zamboanga.


""We will use the full force of the law to bring to justice the perpetrators behind this incident,"" said Delfin Lorenzana, the Defence Secretary; he described the attacks as a ""dastardly act"" and urged vigilant locals to assist authorities and ""deny terrorism any victory"". The first bomb went off within the Roman Catholic cathedral; the second in its car park. Lorenzana said he had ordered 'heightened alert' from troops, and that the army protect places of worship.


The Philippines is a Catholic majority nation. This week saw a referendum seeking to create a new autonomous, self-administered region in Muslim-majority Mindanao, potentially ending decades of conflict with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Of the 2.8 million who voted, 85% were in favour and on Friday the government announced the new region, to be called Bangsamoro, would be governing itself from 2022. 


Jolo, and the Sulu region it is within, were among the areas to vote against the measure. Bangsamoro is nevertheless to include them within it.


Arnel dela Vega of the army's Western Mindanao Command said the Abu Sayyaf Group are the suspected perpetrators. The first bomb went off during Mass; video footage from the scene shows wooden pews broken and scattered within the building. Regional Governor Mujiv Hataman agreed, saying only this organisation appeared capable of the double bombing. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which is linked to the Abu Sayyaf Group, subsequently claimed responsibility.


The Coast Guard said their casualties were attending mass. The deceased seaman was identified as Jaypee Galicha by a Coast Guard spokesperson. The Coast Guard has announced an order by Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Elson Hermogino directing Coast Guard units nearby to ""join personnel from the [army and police] in the investigation and pursuit of the perpetrators.""


Statements of condemnation have come from Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) head Yousef Al-Othaimeen, Pope Francis, and a spokesperson for President Rodrigo Duterte. The OIC is the largest group representing nations with mainly Muslim populations.

The bomb was placed on a motorcycle in a market, stated Minister of Information Moammar al-Eryani, and was left outside a restaurant. No claims of responsibility were reported yesterday, but the general manager of Abu Dhabi Media, Dr Ali bin Tamim, attributed the bombing to Houthi rebels. Similar attributions of responsibility were made by state news firm Saba and al-Eryani.


Tamim claimed Houthis have attacked journalists previously. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports sixteen other journalist deaths in the nation since 2015. According to al-Eryani, the rebels are backed by Iran. 


Mokha is generally less affected by violence than other parts of Yemen, since it was recaptured from Houthis in 2017. It is host to an anti-Houthi, pro-government coalition fighting the Houthis. Yemen has been experiencing civil war since the capital, Sanaa, fell under Houthi control in 2014. At present, the United Nations is attempting a peacekeeping mission.


Expressions of condolences have come from social media users, Sky News Arabia producer Jamal al-Harbi, and al-Eryani.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Toronto_serial_killer_Bruce_McArthur_pleads_guilty_to_eight_murders,2019-02-01,Toronto serial killer Bruce McArthur pleads guilty to eight murders,"Friday, February 1, 2019 


Bruce McArthur, from Toronto, Canada, on Tuesday admitted his guilt in eight murders. McArthur pleaded guilty to each crime at the Superior Court.


Beginning in 2010 and continuing for seven years, McArthur murdered gay men; all but one victim was found dismembered in large planters at a house he had access to. The eighth was discovered in a nearby ravine. McArthur's first victim of the eight was 40-year-old Skandaraj Navaratnam, a former boyfriend and employee of McArthur. The 67-year-old killer had kept a bracelet of Navaratnam's.


Other items kept from victims include a notebook from one victim and further jewellery from another. A search of McArthur's van found an alleged murder weapon, which was not publicly identified; inside McArthur's home was a bag with syringes, a glove, duct tape, zip ties, and a bungee cord. Six of the murders were, according to agreed facts heard in court, ""sexual in nature"" and five of those involved ligatures.


Several of the deceased had links to an area of the city known as the Gay Village. Many were vulnerable, but the final victim, LGBT activist Andrew Kinsman, 49, was quickly reported missing. It is now known McArthur was twice interviewed by police during the killings before he was linked to them.


McArthur travelled selling socks and other undergarments. He also ran a small landscaping business.


Sentencing is scheduled for February 4. McArthur faces a mandatory life sentence with a minimum term of 25 years for first-degree murder; the prosecution can seek to run these consecutively.


Toronto Police, which indicated on Monday a ""significant development"" was likely at Tuesday's hearing, face allegations they failed to react quickly enough to the series of disappearances. Some members of the local LGBT community have been critical; mayor John Tory on Tuesday suggested a broader probe into the surrounding circumstances may be required. National LGBT news source Daily Xtra‍'s editorial director, Rachel Giese, said she felt Tuesday's pleas might provide ""some solace for the families and friends of the victims, and for the community more broadly,"" but would not answer questions being asked of authorities.

After a jury trial in Paris, two French police officers were found guilty on Thursday of raping a Canadian tourist in 2014. Both on Thursday received seven-year prison terms. The case has attracted widespread attention.


—Testimony from the chief internal police investigator

Emily Spanton, 39, who has waived her right to anonymity, met officers Antoine Quirin and Nicolas Redouane, 40 and 49, at an Irish pub. They worked for the Brigade de Recherche et d’Intervention, an elite anti-gang unit tasked with investigating serious offending, and offered Spanton a late night tour of the famed police headquarters at 36 Quai des Orfèvres.


CCTV captured their arrival at the building, entering at 0:40 after Spanton smoked a cigarette; she departed in tears, without her tights, and carrying her shoes at 2:00. In between, she testified, she was gang raped by Quirin, Redouane, and an unidentified third officer. She told the court she was forced to drink whiskey and perform oral sex on the men before being raped.


She told a guard at the door, in French and English, ""they raped me"". The defendants claimed Spanton first complained of theft (vol), not rape (viol). Quirin denied any sexual activity, but upon learning his DNA was on Spanton's underwear he claimed sex had been consensual; Redouane consistently claimed sex was consensual. Photographs, videos, and text messages from the night were deleted by the two officers, who were allowed to go home within hours of the allegation.


Spanton had her home and computer searched; officers traveled to Canada and interviewed her friends and family. An initial attempt to prosecute Quirin and Redouane failed; the case was thrown out of court due to insufficient evidence, but an appeal by Spanton and prosecutors secured the opportunity to present the evidence to a jury. At trial, she was questioned on her clothing, and her drinking and sexual habits. Unlike the accused, Spanton was tested for alcohol. She was also drug tested and questioned for hours.


Howard Rubel, a Toronto lawyer representing Spanton, told the BBC after the verdict ""My client is of course very relieved with the verdict and is glad that she withstood the very arduous process that led to today. She is glad that she did her part in allowing justice to unfold."" Sophie Obadia, another lawyer for the victim, told reporters ""Women in France who have been raped don't have to justify their private life. The court has found that Mme Spanton did not lie, she is not a liar. She was portrayed as a liar, she did not lie.""


—One of the victim's lawyers

Both officers indicated they would appeal; Quirin wept in his lawyer's arms when convicted. In addition to prison, the men's identities, protected during the three-week trial owing to their police jobs, are now public and they are to pay €20,000 (£17,500; US$22,900) in compensation. 


The head of the police's internal investigators told the court ""Basic investigations weren't done."" She also said ""I regret we weren’t called immediately. If we had been, I could have made efforts to secure the scene. We could also have heard the officers more rapidly."" In the event, the scene was not secured. The officers, although initially suspended from duty, are back to work. They indicated they would seek suspension of their imprisonment pending their appeals.

The Center for Biological Diversity announced on Wednesday the monarch butterfly population counted over-wintering in Mexico was 144% greater than last year, with the highest overall population since the winter of 2006–2007. Scientists cautioned against an excess of optimism for the species.


Remarked Center for Biological Diversity scientist Tierra Curry, ""This reprieve from bad news on monarchs is a thank-you from the butterflies to all the people who planted native milkweeds and switched to organic corn and soy products[...] But one good weather year won't save the monarch in the long run, and more protections are needed for this migratory wonder and its summer and winter habitats."" Milkweed is the sole food of the monarch caterpillar.


According to ecologist Chip Taylor of the University of Kansas, last year's relatively cool temperatures in the insects' migration corridor kept them in the right place at the right time to lay eggs with a good chance of survival. He also said this is not likely to happen again next year. Ecologist Ryan Norris of the University of Guelph in Ontario also said human actions had little to do with the increased population.


Almost all of the monarch butterflies ranging across the continent, as far north as Canada, return to the same wintering area in central Mexico's oyamel fir forests every year.  Scientists from the World Wildlife Fund Mexico estimate the population by observing the area turned orange by butterfly bodies on the trees.  This year, the butterflies occupied roughly 6.05 hectares (14.95 acres; .0605 square km), up from 2.48 (6.12 acres) last year.  The hibernation area was as large as 21 hectares in the 1990s and as low as under a hectare in 2014.  


Factors cited for the drop in the monarch's overall population include habitat loss, loss of milkweed to agricultural herbicides, and use of insecticides.


The Center for Biological Diversity and Center for Food Safety requested monarch butterflies be given Endangered Species Act protections from the United States government in 2014.  The decision is pending and expected in June of this year. George Kimbrell of the Center for Food Safety said ""This year's count is a temporary reprieve that doesn't change what the law and science demands, which is that we protect monarchs under the Endangered Species Act before it's too late.""

State media on Saturday reported a war-damaged five-storey block of flats collapsed in a former rebel-held neighbourhood of Aleppo, Syria. The accident in Salaheddin district killed eleven, with a child the sole survivor.


The district was recaptured by the state in 2016 following heavy bombing, in an operation supported by Russia. Little reconstruction has taken place, with such reconstruction efforts as have occurred, by the state, focused on infrastructure. According to AFP, other buildings in Salaheddin are similarly close to collapse.


Rescuers, some using only their hands, dug out the surviving child. Buildings around the collapsed block bear damage from the ongoing conflict. The survivor was rescued from beneath broken breeze blocks.


The United States, which has retreated from a previous goal of ousting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has stated reconstruction will cost between US$300 and 400 billion. The US has further indicated no support will come without political reform in Syria. Satellite imaging from 2017, from the United Nations, suggests Aleppo contained 35,000 war-damaged structures at that time.


China, Iran, and Russia have pledged funds and Syria is taxing certain goods toward the cost of reconstruction.

A bus carrying children from Smolensk to Kaluga on Sunday overturned in Babyninsky, Russia. At least seven, including four children, died.


At least 45 were aboard, with occupants trapped for hours at the snowy roadside in the upended vehicle until rescuers extracted them from the scene. Police have opened a criminal case against the driver and detained him for questioning. The occupants were going to a dance competition, according to the mayor of Yartsevo via news agency Interfax. Local officials said 24 people have been hospitalised, but Agence France-Presse reported as many as 32 hospitalised.


The Emergency Situations Ministry stated all occupants were from Smolensk. Officials said most of the injured were minors. Russia suffers one of the highest death tolls from road accidents in the world, reportedly 18.9 deaths per 100,000 people per year; this is lower than previous years. The Emergencies Ministry has, in a statement, called on drivers to ""not forget that the health and lives of other people depend on you."" It also urged people to ""comply with the established rules of behaviour on the road.""


The Emergency Situations Ministry further indicated no additional vehicles were involved and suggested the driver lost control and left the road. The cause of the accident was not known. Dozens of occupants required extricated.

On Monday, Nevada became the first state in the United States to begin a state legislative session in which more than half of the elected officials were women, at 50.8 percent.


State Senator Patricia Ann Spearman remarked, ""It's been a long, hard fight. I'm starting to see some of the fruits of not just my labor, but the labor of so many other people whose names I don't know,"" further remarking, ""Women in Nevada have said, 'It's time to do away with the patriarchy that that holds people down. It's just time to do away with it.'"" Democrat Spearman, a minister and former Army colonel, was first elected to the state senate in 2012 when she was about 57.


Newly elected Assemblywoman Selena Torres said, ""It's really exciting to be part of this female majority, but also to be a Latina sitting in that majority[...] And when you have students that are recognizing, maybe for the first time, that they too have the ability to be involved and run for office, it truly highlights the importance.""


According to Rutgers University political scholar Kelly Dittmar, ""Women hold fewer than 30 percent of state legislative seats across the country, fewer than 25 percent of congressional seats, so getting to 50 percent in any one place is something significant."" Dittmar went on to add, ""If we want to see parity, it means that we also need to increase the number of Republican women, because we're not going to get to gender parity in most places if we don't fare better in both parties."" Among women serving in state legislatures nationwide, about 70 percent belong to the Democratic party.


A Republican Assemblywoman, Jill Tolles, also commented on party disparity among female candidates: ""Before I ran for office I did look at the makeup and think, 'There's just not as many females in the Republican Party, and how do we change that?'""


Colorado also has a female majority in its lower house but not in its state legislature overall.  New Hampshire also once had a female majority in one house but does not have one now.  In the country overall, women hold about 28 percent of legislative seats.  


The United States has both a federal-level legislative body, made up of the Senate and House of Representatives, which make laws applicable to the entire country; and separate state and local legislatures, which make laws applicable only to that specific state or other district.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Pioneering_oceanographer_Walter_Munk_dies_of_pneumonia_in_California,2019-02-11,Pioneering oceanographer Walter Munk dies of pneumonia in California,"Monday, February 11, 2019 


The death of pioneering oceanographer Walter Munk was announced on Friday by the University of California, San Diego. He was 101 and died of pneumonia in La Jolla, California.


Munk was born in Austria, but he emigrated to the United States to pursue his education, before moving to California in 1939 due to a love interest in La Jolla. Although this romance failed, he remained there, taking a job at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He served in the US Army in World War Two, before being recalled to Scripps where he assisted in work to predict likely wave conditions during Allied landings on both Pacific and Atlantic coasts. He also researched ways to counter military submarines.


Munk's work was later used during the D-Day landings. Post-war, he was involved in nuclear weapons research, observing a 1950s atomic bomb test from a raft and receiving fallout from it. Other research interests included oceanic currents and the interrelation of the sea with the planetary climate.


Earning a post-war PhD in oceanography from University of California, Los Angeles, Munk was an early scientific adopter of scuba equipment and in addition to physical processes was also interested in marine life. A species of devil ray known to leap out the water as if taking flight was named after Munk.


""Walter was the most brilliant scientist I have ever known,"" said University of California, San Diego's chancellor, Pradeep Khosla. Khosla talked of Munk's ""countless discoveries that put the university on the map as a great research institution"" and ""his global leadership on the great scientific issues of our time."" Scripps Oceanography director Margaret Leinen said ""Munk has been a world treasure for ocean science and geophysics."" She described him as ""a guiding force, a stimulating force, a provocative force in science for 80 years"" who was ""one of the most distinguished and honored scientists in the world"" and ""always interested in sparking a discussion about what's coming next.""


Awards included a trip to the White House to receive the US National Medal of Science, and the French Legion of Honour, received last year during a visit to Paris. 


His wife Mary said ""We thought he would live forever. His legacy will be his passion for the ocean, which was endless.""

On Saturday, Thailand's Thai Raksa Chart Party withdrew from using Princess Ubolratana Mahidol as their candidate for prime minister in response to a statement from her younger brother, King Maha Vajiralongkorn.  Shortly after she formally filed for candidacy, the palace issued a statement to the effect the king considered it inappropriate for Thai royals to run for elected office.  The constitutionality of the Princess's candidacy had also been challenged by the opposing military political party.


The palace issued the following statement from the king: ""Even though she relinquished her title according to royal laws [...] she still retains her status and position as a member of the Chakri dynasty [...] Involvement of a high-ranking member of the royal family in politics, in whatever way, is an act that conflicts with the country's traditions, customs, and culture, and therefore is considered extremely inappropriate.""


""Thai Raksa Chart party complies with the royal command,"" the party informed the press. The election is scheduled for March 24.


This past Friday, the princess, 67, announced her candidacy for the prime ministry under the Thai Raksa Chart Party, making her the first Thai royal to seek elected office.


The Thai Raksa Chart party was founded by supporters of the Shinawatra family.  A military coup removed then-prime-minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006, and another his sister Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014, which placed incumbent Prayuth Chan-o-cha in office.  The Thai Raksa Chart Party did not immediately announce whom they would support to run against Chan-o-cha.


Thai law forbids both speaking ill of the royal family and using the monarchy for a political campaign.  Officially, Princess Ubolratana no longer holds a royal title, having lost it in 1972 upon her marriage to a U.S. national whom she met while studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Although she has since divorced and returned to Thailand, her title was not restored.


In support of her candidacy, Princess Ubolratana pointed out she had ""relinquished my royal titles and lived as a commoner[.]"" Sources report she is generally treated as royalty by the Thai populace.  Following the party's announcement, she used Instagram to thank supporters.


The country's election commission is scheduled to discuss the events of this past weekend on Monday. They are required to rule by this coming Friday on the acceptability of all candidates.


The Thai monarchy was limited by a constitution in 1932.

German migrant marine rescue charity Sea-Eye on Sunday renamed their ship after Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian child who drowned offshore of Turkey. Relatives of the boy attended the renaming ceremony on the Spanish island of Majorca.


Kurdi, his brother, and his mother were among eleven migrants who died in a storm on the Mediterranean Sea in 2015; they had, his surviving father says, paid people smugglers to take them from Turkey to Greece in a small inflatable boat. A photograph of his remains on a Turkish beach drew widespread attention. The accident happened during the height of the European migrant crisis, which saw a large spike in immigration to the continent.


""This day is very hard for me, as I re-experience many memories,"" said his father, Abdullah Kurdi, following the ceremony. ""It's people with good heart in this organization. So my boy's name stands for something good and his little soul can find ... peace."" Abdullah Kurdi now resides in Iraq. The boy's aunt, Tima Kurdi, also attended the ceremony.


Sea-Eye spokesperson Carlotta Weibl said ""The name 'Alan Kurdi' shall be a reminder of what our work is really about. It is not about ships, captains, NGOs [Non-Governmental Organizations] and clashes with misguided politicians. It is about actual persons, like Alan, [and his brother and mother], who drown in the Mediterranean daily[, and] it is about the endless pain and grief their loved ones have to feel."" Sea-Eye credit themselves with around 14,000 lives saved during 60 rescues since commencing work in 2016. Their ship, MV Alan Kurdi, was previously MV Professor Albrecht Penck.


Turkey sentenced two people smugglers to four years of prison each for their roles in the events surrounding Kurdi and his fellow migrants' September 2015 deaths. Kurdi's image lead to international public calls for more effort to assist migrants from Syria; since then, anti-immigration groups have increased their numbers and activities in Europe.

The Hotel Arpit Palace in the Karol Bagh area of the Indian capital, New Delhi, caught fire yesterday morning. At least seventeen people died and 35 were rescued, according to officials, some of whom were hospitalised. 


Many of the affected guests were Indian; the Myanma embassy confirmed two Buddhist pilgrims from Myanmar also died. The area is popular with visitors, with budget hotels and shopping districts. Firefighters dispatched around 30 vehicles; personnel reportedly had control of the blaze by 8:00am local time. No cause was immediately known, but a fire officer said wooden panels led to corridors becoming unusable for escape.


Local media reported most of the deceased suffocated. One child was, according to the fire service, among the dead. The hotel's website estimated 120 people were in the 25-year-old building at the time. A judicial inquiry was ordered, according to police. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted ""Deeply saddened by the loss of lives"" and offered ""condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. May the injured recover soon.""


According to eyewitnesses, the deceased child and his mother were among victims who leapt from the burning hotel. The top floor has been extensively damaged and blackened by the blaze. Satyendra Jain, the city's home minister, said ""Buildings can only be constructed up to four floors in Delhi[...] This hotel had been built up to six floors. It's gross negligence on the part of the officers who allowed the extra floors to be built. The entire hotel has wooden panelling, this shows carelessness on the part of the owner.""

On Wednesday, scientists from the University of Miami and Apex Shark Expeditions published a study in Scientific Reports, an on-line journal, documenting the disappearance of the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) from a specific area off the coast of South Africa.  The study found that when the whites disappeared, a Jurassic-era predator called the sevengill shark (Notorhynchus cepedianus) moved in.


The study was a collaborative project between Neil Hammerschlag of the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami and Chris Fallows of Apex Shark Expeditions, a company that conducts cage diving and shark viewing trips.


The study covered more than 8000 hours of shark observations in South Africa's False Bay spread out over the past 18 years.  The great white shark population remained relatively stable until 2015, at which point their numbers went into sharp decline, sometimes reaching zero during 2017–2018.  At those times, another predator, the sevengill shark, previously unknown in the study area, began to appear.  The sevengill is sometimes called a living fossil because it closely resembles similar sharks from prehistoric times.


Fallows remarked, ""In 18+ years of working at Seal Island, we had never seen sevengill sharks in our surveys[...] Following the disappearance of white sharks in 2017, sevengill began to show up for the first time and have been increasing in number ever since.""


The study itself outlined the tight correlation between the absence of white sharks and the presence of sevengills: ""[S]evengill sharks [...] were only detected during the prolonged periods of complete white shark absence, disappearing from our surveys during the intermittent short periods when white sharks temporarily returned to Seal Island, albeit in very low numbers, only to reappear when the white sharks were again absent from surveys[.]""


The sevengill shark usually lives in areas where the sea floor is thick with kelp, as opposed to the relatively clear-bottomed study area.  The sevengill and great white are both ordinarily apex predators and seek some of the same food, such as cape fur seals, but great whites can also prey directly on sevengills.  The great white shark and orca are the only species known to eat adult sevengills.  The sevengill has seven gills, whereas most species of shark have only five gills on each side of their bodies.


The scientists behind the present study only noted various hypotheses about the cause of the disappearance of great white sharks from this area, though Dr. Alison Kock of the University of Cape Town has reported a correlation with the entry of orcas into False Bay, possibly because human activity has rendered prey hard to find elsewhere.  These orcas, she suggested, specialize in hunting sharks.


The researchers noted the sevengill sharks might not have the same effect on the ecosystems involved as the great whites have had, citing the ecological disruption apparently caused off Alaska when a change in orca behavior had a knock-on effect, disrupting sea otters' predation of sea urchins, whose population then exploded, plowing through the area's kelp forests.

On Monday, attorneys general from sixteen states filed a combined lawsuit against the state of emergency United States President Donald Trump declared last Friday so he could fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border.


The motion claims Trump's declaration is unconstitutional, and that the states filing suit have standing to do so because building the wall would divert funding away from programs that would otherwise be performed to the benefit of these states.  Because only Congress may allocate funds in this way, reads the motion, the declaration of state of emergency violates the United States Constitution's separation of powers clause.  The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for Northern District of California.


Trump's state of emergency appears to allow him to pull funding for the border wall from other places: potentially, according to Al Jazeera, US$3.6 billion from a Pentagon construction budget, $2.5 billion from anti-drug programs, and $601 million from a forfeiture fund within the U.S. Treasury Department.


""President Trump treats the rule of law with utter contempt,"" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. ""He knows there is no border crisis, he knows his emergency declaration is unwarranted, and he admits that he will likely lose this case in court.""


Becerra is joined in this legal action by attorneys general from Maine, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, and Hawaii.


On Friday, President Trump declared a state of emergency so he could begin the construction of additional wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, claiming this would stem illegal immigration.  Congress has repeatedly denied funding for such a wall, and the conflict between congressional leaders and the president caused a delay in budgetary decisions that led to a government shutdown lasting several weeks this past December and January.  On Friday, Congress approved a budget authorizing funding with about a quarter as much money  as the president had requested for a border wall.  He declared a state of emergency the same day.


This is not the first lawsuit to be filed against the state of emergency. On Friday, an environmental group and private property owners from the border state of Texas filed a motion claiming the state of emergency is unconstitutional and violated their property rights.

In findings published on Wednesday in PLoS One, scientists from the University of Bristol and UC Davis say zebras may have gotten their stripes to confuse ectoparasites, such as flies.


The researchers observed tabanid horse flies around zebras and domestic horses in captive settings and they found the flies had a harder time landing on zebras than on the monochrome coats of the horses.


Results showed the horse flies hovered over both types of animals at roughly the same rate but, over zebras, they did not always slow down fast enough to land successfully.  They then equipped horses with both zebra-striped and unstriped cloths and again observed that the flies had trouble landing on the striped surfaces.


""This reduced ability to land on the zebra's coat may be due to stripes disrupting the visual system of the horse flies during their final moments of approach. Stripes may dazzle flies in some way once they are close enough to see them with their low-resolution eyes[,]"" said study co-author and Royal Society University Research Fellow Martin How.


Scientists have long wondered about the evolutionary impetus behind zebras' coat patterns.  Other hypotheses include the idea that stripes may confuse predators, facilitate social interactions within the herd, and regulate body temperature.


In Africa, where zebras evolved, flies can carry dangerous blood-borne pathogens.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Texas_federal_judge_says_drafting_only_men_violates_United_States_Constitution,2019-02-25,Texas federal judge says drafting only men violates United States Constitution,"Monday, February 25, 2019 


On Friday, a federal judge in Texas ruled the United States federal government's practice of registering men but not women for the draft, or military conscription, is unconstitutional.


In response to a lawsuit by the men's rights group National Coalition for Men, U.S. District Judge Gray Miller ruled the male-only draft violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. He said the rationale for difference along gender lines from a previous Supreme Court ruling, that women were ineligible to serve in combat, no longer applies.  Women, who make up 16% of the U.S. military enlisted and 18% of officers as of 2016, according to nonprofit CNA, have been serving official combat roles since 2015.


""While historical restrictions on women in the military may have justified past discrimination,"" reads Judge Miller's statement, ""men and women are now 'similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft.' [...] If there ever was a time to discuss 'the place of women in the Armed Services,' that time has passed.""


By law, all male permanent residents of the United States over the age of 18 must register for the Selective Service System. This both renders them eligible for certain public services and identifies them for the draft, or military conscription, were a draft to be imposed.


Part of the judge's statement reads ""the average woman could conceivably be better suited physically for some of today's combat positions than the average man, depending on which skills the position required. Combat roles no longer uniformly require sheer size or muscle."" He went on to cite the Supreme Court ruling permitting same-sex marriage.


The ruling was a declaration, placing no injunction on the government to immediately change the Selective Service System.


There is currently a commission engaged to study the role of the draft, and the government asked Judge Miller to delay his ruling until after they made their recommendations, but he declined. USA Today noted the commission's scope allows it to advise including women in the draft or eliminating the draft entirely.


The last draft in the United States took place in 1973 during the Vietnam War.

On Wednesday, nine men were jailed due to sexual abuse and rape of two teenage girls at a children's home in Bradford, England. A tenth defendant was found not-guilty. 


The nine men were prosecuted for 22 different crimes. These included rape and inciting child prostitution.


Judge Durham Hall QC said they ""appear not to have shown any respect for the minimum standards of decent behaviour."" Prosecutor Kama Melly QC said the victims were ""ripe and vulnerable to manipulation"" and had been used ""to satisfy [the accused's] sexual desires"".


One of the victims decided to allow her name to be made public. She said she did this to show victims ""there is nothing to be ashamed of"". One of the victims said the men thought they were ""nothing but a toy to play with"".


Bradford Council stated, ""The Safeguarding Board will look closely at this case to see if there are any lessons we can learn that could help us keep young people safer"".

On Sunday, the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule successfully docked with the International Space Station in orbit around the Earth.  Although the Crew Dragon was carrying only cargo and a mannequin equipped with sensors, this was the first time since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011 a United States spacecraft capable of carrying humans has made it to the station.


Most of the docking process was automatic by the capsule, though the crew of the ISS were able to send the capsule commands to perform simple movements.  Previous SpaceX pods have relied on the station's own robotic arm apparatus to take hold of them.


At 2:49 a.m. local time (7:49 a.m. UTC) on Saturday morning, the Crew Dragon was launched via a Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida in the southeastern United States.


Crew Dragon has enough room for seven people but on this occasion carried only a mannequin, nicknamed ""Ripley"" for Sigourney Weaver's character in the film Alien.  The Crew Dragon is scheduled to remain at the station during the week and return to Earth on Friday.


Bill Gerstenmaier of NASA spoke of the collaboration between his agency and SpaceX: ""It's fun working with a new partner that approaches the problem in a slightly different way. They don't carry the same background that we did in NASA, and they don't approach the design exactly the same way we do. [...] And that's cool. I mean, that's really neat.""


""To be frank I'm a little emotionally exhausted because that was super stressful. But it worked — so far,"" SpaceX founder Elon Musk told the press after the launch. ""We have to dock to the station, and we have to come back, but so far it's worked. [...] We've passed some of the riskiest items."" 


The short-term goal of NASA's Commercial Crew Program is to restore NASA's ability to send humans into orbit, which it has been unable to do since retiring the space shuttles in 2011.  Longer term, according to NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, the goal is to render space accessible to many customers and, through commercial competition, do so at a lower cost than the space shuttle missions, which ran about US$1.5 billion apiece. Currently, NASA pays for Russian spacecraft to carry living people, at roughly US$80 million per astronaut.


NASA has selected two astronauts, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken, for Crew Dragon's first manned mission, which NASA said might take place this summer.


The Boeing airframe company is also collaborating with NASA on human-crewable spacecraft and its Starliner craft is scheduled to undergo flight test this spring.  NASA's contract with Boeing is currently valued at US$4.2 billion.  The contract with SpaceX is valued at US$2.6 billion.


Last year, SpaceX tested its Falcon Heavy rocket by launching company founder Elon Musk's personal Tesla convertible into space.

A former advisor for U.S. President Donald Trump was sentenced in U.S. Federal Court on Wednesday. Paul Manafort was sentenced by Judge Amy Berman Jackson to 73 months in federal prison and to also pay financial restitution to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of US$6.16 million.


Manafort's charges involved unregistered foreign lobbying and witness tampering. Judge Jackson clarified in the proceedings that her sentencing decisions were not connected to or impacted by the sentence Manafort received in a separate case for which Manafort was sentenced last week. However, as part of her admonition, Judge Jackson stated, ""Saying I'm sorry I got caught is not an inspiring plea for leniency."" 


In last week's action, another federal judge sentenced Manafort to a 47 month prison term. After his conviction in that case last summer, Manafort agreed to help with Robert Mueller's investigation. However, some months later, the judge in that case determined Manafort had lied and violated that deal. That conviction was related to Manafort's lobbying business. 


In 2018, while preparing for his first trial, Manafort was kept in solitary confinement at least 23 hours per day. In that trial, he faced 18 counts of fraud pertaining to his financial reporting for his pay while working on a foreign campaign in Ukraine.

An Australian, Brenton Tarrant, aged 28, appeared in Christchurch District Court, New Zealand yesterday, charged with one count of murder pertaining to a mass shooting in Christchurch on Friday, which caused the death of at least 50 people. Judge Paul Kellar ordered the accused remain in custody until his next court appearance on April 5.


Police alleged the accused performed two attacks. The first attack reportedly was in Al Noor Mosque at about 13:40 local time (0040 UTC), which left at least 42 people dead. The second attack reportedly was in Linwood Mosque, killing at least eight people, on the same day. Brenton Tarrant did not apply for bail. Further charges may be laid in the future, police said.


Police arrested the accused in the neighborhood of Strickland Street, 36 minutes after the mass shooting in Al Noor Mosque according to police. After his arrest on Friday, Brenton stayed in the Christchurch central police station overnight before appearing in court on the next day.


Brenton Tarrant had a valid gun licence allowing him to buy weapons, ABC reported. According to New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Brenton had a licence for the five firearms he allegedly used for the attack — two semi-automatic, two shotguns, and one lever-action. Professor Greg Barton, Chair In Global Islamic Politics in the Faculty of Arts and Education at the Deakin University, said ""The attacker was using a couple of guns, one was a shotgun, one was an AR-15 — that's the so-called civilian equivalent of the M-16. It's an assault rifle"". The authorities seized these firearms.


Prime Minister Ardern said at a press conference yesterday morning the gun laws should be changed. She said, ""I have instructed ODESC [Officials Committee for Domestic and External Security Coordination] to report to Cabinet on Monday on these events with a view to strengthening our systems on a range of fronts including, but not limited to, firearms, border controls, enhanced information-sharing with Australia, and any practice reinforcement of our watchlist processes.""


Brenton also allegedly released an anti-Muslim document online, outlining political motivation, prior to the murders. Social media have been struggling to censor the alleged gunman's videos of the murder, according to reports.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Fur_fans_flock_to_Toronto%27s_Furnal_Equinox_2019,2019-03-25,Fur fans flock to Toronto's Furnal Equinox 2019,"Monday, March 25, 2019 


From March 15 to 17, the Canadian city of Toronto played host to the tenth Furnal Equinox, an annual event dedicated to the ""furry fandom."" Wikinews attended. Programming ranged from music to gender, science to art, covering dozens of aspects of the varied subculture. The event's featured guests were visual artists Moth Monarch and Cat-Monk Shiro, as well as the co-owners of US fursuit costume builders Don't Hug Cacti.


The event raised nearly CDN$11,000 for Pet Patrol, a non-profit rescue organization in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, run by volunteers. This exceeded their goal of $10,000, the funds needed to finish a rural sanctuary. The furry community is well-known for their charitable efforts. Along with direct donations, the funds were raised through a charity auction offering original artwork, and a fursuit design by guests of honour ""Don't Hug Cacti."" Last year, Furnal Equinox raised funds for a farm animal sanctuary.


While only 10–15% of people within the fandom own a fursuit according to a 2011 study, event organizers reported this year 908 of the 2240 attendees at Furnal Equinox brought at least one elaborate outfit to the event. The outfits are usually based on original characters, known as ""fursonas"".


Guests of Honour Cherie and Sean O'Donnell, known within the community as ""Lucky and Skuff Coyote"", held a session on fursuit construction on Saturday afternoon. The married couple are among the most prominent builders in the fandom, under the name Don't Hug Cacti. The scale of their business was evident, as Sean had made over a thousand pairs of ""handpaws"", costume gloves.


The couple encouraged attendees to continue developing their technique, sharing that all professional fursuit makers had developed different techniques. They felt that they learned more from failed projects than successful ones, citing the Chuck Jones quote that ""every artist has thousands of bad drawings,"" and that you have to work through them to achieve. Cherie, known as Lucky, recalled receiving a Sylvester the Cat plush toy from a Six Flags theme park at age 10. She promptly hollowed the toy out, turning it into a costume. Creating a costume isn't without its hazards: the company uses 450°F (232°C) glue guns. They're ""like sticking your hand in an oven.""


Other programming included improv comedy, dances, life drawing of fursuiters, a review of scientific research by a research group at four universities called FurScience, a pin collector's social, and workshops in writing.


The ""Dealer's Den"" hall was expanded this year, with even more retailers and artists. While many offered ""furry"" versions of traditional products, at least one business focused on ""pushing the boundaries of fursuit technology."" Along with 3D printing a bone-shaped name tag when Wikinews visited, Grivik was demonstrating miniature computer screens that could be used as ""eyes"" for a fursuit. The electronic displays projected an animation of eyes looking around, blinking occasionally. The maker has also developed ""a way to install a camera inside suit heads, to improve fursuiter visibility."" He hopes the tech would reduce suiting risks and accidents. Without the need for eyeholes, fursuit makers would have ""more options for building different eyestyles.""

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Thousands_march_in_anti-Brexit_protest,_London",2019-03-28,"Thousands march in anti-Brexit protest, London","Thursday, March 28, 2019 


Estimates by event organizers indicate roughly one million people marched in London on Saturday during an anti-Brexit (""British exit"") march, protesting the pending exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU).


Protesters, carrying placards asking the government to revoke Article 50 — the EU treaty clause invoked by Brexit — and European Union flags, marched from Hyde Park Corner to Parliament. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, tweeted, ""Here in London, thousands of people from across our city and country have come together with @peoplesvote-uk to send a clear message: Enough is enough - it's time to give the British public the final say on Brexit.""


There were several speakers at the rally, including First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, Labour MP (Member of Parliament) Tom Watson, and Sadiq Khan. Tom Watson called Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal ""lousy"" and said he would only vote for it if the British people could also vote for or against it. Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""the moment of maximum opportunity"" for stopping a no-deal Brexit.


Some of the protesters Wikinews interviewed said they had gone to ""defend [their] children's right to live and work in Europe"" and ""secure [their own] right to work in the EU"". One interviewee said people changed their minds and several said they wanted the politicians to stop ignoring them.


Not everyone agreed there should be another referendum. One MP told the BBC, ""We know that 16 million people wanted to stay in the EU, and some of those would still like to stay in the EU, and within that quite a few would like to have another go and have another referendum — but it was always a minority"".


In 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum on whether to remain part of the European union, which it joined in 1973. About 52% of participating voters voted to leave and 48% to stay.

Toronto Comicon 2019 returned to its titular city from March 15 to 17, as one of the largest pop culture events in Canada. The popular event featured celebrity guests like actors Dan Fogler, Ron Perlman, John De Lancie, John Rhys-Davies, and Jaleel White, as well as comic artists, authors, and professional cosplayers. The event included a large show floor with hundreds of retailers and artists promoting their creations. Wikinews' Nicholas Moreau attended the event, taking photos of the various sights.


John Rhys-Davies broke news when he revealed that a Sliders reboot is being considered. ""Jerry [O'Connell] and I are talking to NBC at the moment. The basic problem is that no one knows who owns the rights"". Their legal department had apparently been looking into the matter for two months, as of the convention weekend. Emma Caufield talked of being cast in an NBC television pilot while a recurring guest actor on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Faced with loosing the character of Anya Jenkins, the producers finally committed to making her a regular. ""It was a good day,"" she recalls.


Special effects costumer Ian Campbell, whose screen credits include Star Trek: Discovery, had a booth at the convention displaying his prop replicas and cosplay items. Amidst the bustle of activity, Campbell was working on a Thanos helmet sculpt. After the convention, he told Wikinews that ""it can be tough to maintain focus with so many people streaming past and along questions, but sculpting in front of a crowd at conventions is great because it allows people to see the process that goes into what I do [...] it also can serve as inspiration to other to pursue their own artistic endeavors.""


Lisa Mancini has been cosplaying for two years, her ""passion"" for the hobby ""stemmed through my love for Halloween."" She typically chooses ""to portray beloved characters from childhood or strong females. I also enjoy a good gender bent cosplay to ensure a touch of uniqueness!""


Mancini told Wikinews after the event that the best part of cosplay is ""bringing a character to life."" One of the characters she took on this year was Squirrel Girl, a Marvel Comics character. Mancini has been described by the Daily Hive as a ""squirrel whisperer"", for the close affinity some of the animals have for her.


Stephanie Chapman has knit a variety of knit outfits, an uncommon technique for cosplay. Prompted by Ron Perlman's visit, she wore a costume based on Hellboy character Abe Sapien, which lacks the eyeholes of her normal masks. With ""Abe, I wanted to go for accuracy over comfort,"" Chapman told Wikinews, a choice leaving her largely helpless without a handler. The costume ""is very warm [...] so I have to stay hydrated and try to keep as calm as possible. It's just really hard to stay calm when I meet someone like Ron Perlman"". With the combination of excitement and ""the stress I'm putting on my body"", she shared that she was prone to meltdown in suit.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Turkey%27s_President_Erdogan_proposes_converting_Hagia_Sophia_Museum_to_mosque,2019-03-31,Turkey's President Erdogan proposes converting Hagia Sophia Museum to mosque,"Sunday, March 31, 2019 


On Wednesday, as a part of his pre-election campaign, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan  pledged converting Hagia Sophia, formerly a Greek Orthodox church and now a museum, to a mosque, following the election today. He announced this change by live television on Wednesday and again verbally in a rally on Friday, despite criticism by the Greek foreign minister and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) who questioned his authority to make the change.


On Friday in Istanbul, as a part of an election rally,  Erdogan said, ""After elections, we will change Hagia Sophia's name from museum to mosque[...] We have some plans and we are going to implement these plans."" Earlier this week on Wednesday on the live television, President Erdogan said — as reported by Hurriyet Daily News — ""Ayasofya [Haghia Sophia] will no longer be called a museum. Its status will change. We will call it a mosque"".


This Wednesday Greek Foreign Minister George Katrougalos emphasized the requirement of approval by UNESCO, saying ""It [Haghia Sophia] is not only a great temple of Christendom — the largest for many centuries — it also belongs to humanity. It has been recognized by UNESCO, as part of our global cultural heritage. So any questioning of this status is not just an insult to the sentiments of Christians, it is an insult to the international community and international law"", as quoted by Greek Reporter. In an interview with Sputnik News, UNESCO also said that this change would require its approval.


This Thursday the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) also criticized the move, this time not only implying approval would be required, but also recommending to maintain the status of the monument as a museum. They released a statement which said, ""Hagia Sophia bears profound historical and spiritual significance to Muslims and Christians alike, and its status as a museum must be maintained"".


On live television Erdogan also attacked the proclamation of Golan Heights as official Israeli territory by the President of the United States Donald Trump, which was made on Monday. This proclamation contradicted the United Nations' official position on status of the territory, which belonged to Syria and was occupied by Israel. 


Namely, President Erdogan said on Wednesday, ""Those who remain silent when Masjid Al-Aqsa is attacked, trampled, its windows smashed, cannot tell us what to do about the status of Ayasofya[...] Unfortunately, Trump is behaving like a bully boy[...] How can you do this despite the United Nations? What are you doing? Being at the helm of a state like the U.S. does not give you such a right."" 


Erdogan also said earlier he might rename the monument.  On the live television he said, ""Constantinople will never exist again[...] The name of this area is Islambol [full of Islam] and you know that."" UNESCO reportedly said a change of name of a world heritage site would required approval from the World Heritage Committee.


UNESCO, a specialized agency of the United Nations, is based in Paris.

According to a report on Wednesday by UpGuard, a cybersecurity firm, two databases containing user data from Facebook were found on Amazon.com web servers accessible to the public on the internet. Information leaked included user ID's, photos, Facebook friend and group lists, and interests. 


One of the databases is owned by the Mexican company Cultura Colectiva, which specializes in digital media, while the other is owned by a separate Facebook-integrated app, At the Pool. In these two instances, the records were publicly available because the ""Amazon S3 Buckets"" on which the data were stored were misconfigured to allow public access instead of only private access. The original report was not entirely clear about this point, and Wikinews confirmed with UpGuard that the two incidents involved two separate Amazon S3 buckets.


UpGuard reportedly sent an email to Cultura Colectiva on January 10, and again on January 14, but received no response. On January 28, UpGuard reportedly emailed Amazon Web Services informing them of the situation, to which on February 1 Amazon Web Services acknowledged the bucket's owner had been informed. After the database had still not been secured, UpGuard reportedly emailed Amazon Web Services again on February 21, with Amazon Web services responding that they would investigate what else could be done about it. Reportedly, the Amazon S3 Buckets were only secured after Bloomberg contacted Facebook.


The Guardian drew comparisons between this case and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which over 50 million Facebook profiles were harvested for data without users' knowledge or consent.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/New_studies_may_bring_slug-made_glues_closer_to_use_in_medicine,2019-04-11,New studies may bring slug-made glues closer to use in medicine,"Thursday, April 11, 2019 


In two studies presented on Monday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Orlando, Florida in the United States, scientists have disclosed new steps toward using natural adhesives made by the dusky Arion slug (Arion subfuscus) in medical applications such as in closing skin wounds and reducing scarring.


When threatened, the dusky Arion slug secretes an unusual glue, making itself a difficult target for predators.  This glue remains both sticky and flexible and works even when the surface the slug is on is wet.  Previous studies have shown that, unlike many artificial adhesives, Arion slug glue is non-toxic to mammalian tissue.


Scientist Rebecca Falconer, an Ithaca College undergraduate who led one of the two studies, said ""Typical sutures like staples and stitches often lead to scarring and create holes in the skin that could increase the chance of infection after surgery [...] Understanding the roles of adhesive proteins in the slug glue would aid in the creation of a medical adhesive that can move and stretch yet still retain its strength and adhesiveness.""


In her set of experiments, Falconer observed eleven proteins found only in slug glue and used DNA recombination to produce usable amounts of each of these proteins.  Specifically, she produced complementary DNA sequences (cDNA) for each protein, which are stretches of DNA with all the pieces not necessary for producing the protein removed.  She then spliced these into circular DNA sequences called plasmids, which she inserted into bacteria, whose natural cellular machinery began to produce the proteins in quantity.  She then analyzed the three-dimensional structures that the protein molecules form with each other and with other substances that make them work.


Christopher Gallego-Lazo, also an Ithaca undergrad, evaluated glue from the dusky Arion slug by focusing on the chemical bonds within the glue and the way they affect the glue's deformability.  Gallego-Lazo found that slight changes in these chemical bonds could alter the strength of the slug glue.


Gallego-Lazo said, ""Few studies on biological adhesives have identified the exact nature of the bonds holding the glue together [...] This knowledge can guide the development of an organic synthetic adhesive that would reduce the risk of infection and scarring compared to stitches and staples and could be applied rapidly and simply.""


Falconer and Gallego-Lazo both performed their research in the laboratory of Dr. Andrew Smith.

The roof of Notre Dame cathedral in French capital Paris caught fire yesterday. The spire and at least part of the roof, and at least part of the wooden frame, collapsed. According to officials, the two bell towers were saved. 


The fire reportedly started at about 19:00 local time (1700 UTC). Reportedly over 400 firefighters participated in extinguishing the blaze and were still working as of midnight. Not only did they put out the fire but they continued to cool the structure after the fire was gone to reduce the possibility of further damage.


Officials cleared the area around the cathedral.


The French Civil Security service said water bombing by aircraft was disallowed as it might have caused additional damage to the monument.


As of late yesterday, the fire's cause had not been officially stated. President Emmanuel Macron cancelled an address he was to have given during the evening and instead went to the scene.


Renovation work was ongoing in the building before the fire began. The world-famous cathedral, completed in the 13th century, is one of the most well-known monuments in France.

Yesterday in California's Riverside County criminal court, Judge Bernard Schwartz sentenced David and Louise Turpin to life in prison for torturing all but the youngest of their thirteen children.


As revealed at trial, the Turpins had kept their children indoors for years and rarely allowed them outside the family home, located 70 miles (112 km) south of Los Angeles. The children were banned from washing more often than once a year and could not use the toilet. They were severely malnourished, to the point that some of those who are now adults were initially mistaken for children. The oldest of the Turpin's offspring, age 29, weighed 82 pounds (37 kg).  Another brother, 22, was still chained to a bed when found. None of the twelve had ever received any sort of dental care.


The judge presiding over the case, Bernard Schwartz, said, ""You have severed the ability to interact and raise your children that you have created and brought into this world."" Schwartz went on to say he was not giving them the longest possible sentence because they had ""accepted responsibility at an early stage in the proceeding"" by pleading guilty to fourteen felony charges each and ""spared your children having to relive the humiliation and the harm they endured in that house of horrors."" 


Specifically, both parents faced twelve counts of torture and false imprisonment, nine counts of child abuse, and seven counts of cruelty to a dependent adult.  David Turpin, alone, was also charged with making false statements for the purpose of obtaining a home schooling license.


The father said ""I love my children and I believe my children love me.""


The mother said ""I really look forward to the day I can see them, hug them and tell them I'm sorry.""


One of the children said, ""Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that had happened such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten."" However, this person also said that they still love their parents and had partially forgiven them.


One of them even went as far to say, ""Although it may not have been the best way of raising us, I am glad that they did because it made me the person I am today.""


The two parents were arrested in January of last year after one of their daughters, aged 17, escaped and phoned 911 (the emergency telephone number in the United States). She did not know what address her house was or know the date and said some of her siblings were chained into their beds.


The Turpins are scheduled to be eligible for parole in 25 years.

On Friday Ford Motor Company announced the United States Department of Justice was performing a criminal investigation of Ford's internal emission testing practices. Ford said in a financial filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the criminal investigation started on some unspecified date after Ford voluntarily disclosed the matter to the federal government on February 21.


Ford said in their filing the matter ""currently focuses on issues relating to road load estimations, including analytical modeling and coastdown testing"", and ""does not involve the use of defeat devices"" which were an issue with another automaker previously.


""Ford is fully cooperating with the government, and we'll keep them posted on what we're finding through our investigation and technical review"", Ford told The Verge. In the filing itself Ford also made this point, writing ""In addition, we have notified a number of other state and federal agencies. We are fully cooperating with all government agencies.""


In February, Ford announced investigating itself, following employee concerns that emission testing calculation could be inconsistent. The employees were reportedly concerned about the calculation of ""road load"", a measurement of ordinary resistance factors such as tire resistance and aerodynamic drag. 


Ford started its investigation by hiring law firm Sidley Austin, according to The Verge.


According to the filing, Ford voluntarily disclosed this matter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on February 18, and also to the California Air Resources Board on February 21.

Friday, May 3, 2019 


As part of the celebration of 900 years of the Cahors Cathedral in Cahors, France, celebration ongoing through April, a precious relic was carried in procession through the streets of the city on Saturday, April 27: the Holy Headdress of Christ. 


The Holy Headdress is recognized by tradition as the veil that covered the head of Jesus when he was buried.  By one tradition, Charlemagne brought back the relic of Jerusalem and offered it to the diocese of Cahors.  The relic has been venerated in Cahors since the construction of the cathedral 900 years ago.


The ""Sainte Coiffe"" got back into the streets of Cahors for the first time in nearly eight decades. The relic was carried in procession followed by, according to varying reports, nearly 2000 people, perhaps some hundreds more, in an event both for believers and curious. The procession made its way at the pace of hymns and prayers, through the narrow streets of the town, then on the banks of the Lot, and ended on the forecourt of the cathedral.


The event was sustained by the city of Cahors, the State of France, and the civil society, for which many people have invested themselves, including volunteers.



Other celebrations and other events have been planned in Cahors until December.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Scientific_study_suggests_dinosaurs_flapped_their_wings_as_they_ran,2019-05-05,Scientific study suggests dinosaurs flapped their wings as they ran,"Sunday, May 5, 2019 


In findings published on Thursday in PLoS Computational Biology, scientists from China's Tsinghua University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported bird flight may have evolved from wing-flapping by running dinosaurs. These findings support the hypothesis flight could have evolved up from the ground, in contrast to models in which active flapping flight evolved after gliding, a passive form of flight. 


The authors proposed that in Caudipteryx, from a mechanical perspective, two-legged running automatically induced wing flapping. The authors of the report used a mathematical model, a robot, and young ostriches to test their hypotheses.



For the study, the researchers chose Caudipteryx zoui, a dinosaur about the size of a peacock known to have feathered wings but not flight.  It weighed about ten lbs (five kg) and the researchers estimate it had a top speed of about 18 mph (8 m/s).  Using modal effective mass theory, the team conceptualized the dinosaur's body as a series of springs and other components, first as a computer model and then as a physical robot.  In both scenarios, running at medium speed produced vibrations making the animal's wings flap.

Co-author Jing-Shan Zhao said, ""Our work shows that the motion of flapping feathered wings was developed passively and naturally as the dinosaur ran on the ground[...] Although this flapping motion could not lift the dinosaur into the air at that time, the motion of flapping wings may have developed earlier than gliding.""


They also attached sets of artificial wings to juvenile ostriches about the same size as Caudipteryx.  They found the faster each ostrich ran, the more it tended to flap, with larger wings providing more lift.


John Hutchinson, an evolutionary biomechanicist at London's Royal Veterinary College, questioned the findings, saying Caudipteryx might have dealt with the vibrations by holding its forelimbs tight against its body instead of flapping.  ""However,"" he told Science News, ""this study does lay groundwork that could be built upon and tested more rigorously. So perhaps it will inspire deeper insight in the future.""


Although Caudipteryx is in the same evolutionary group as birds and other theropods, it lived millions of years after flying dinosaurs, such as Archaeopteryx, were already in the air.


While current consensus among scientists says birds as we understand them evolved from theropod dinosaurs, there are several competing ideas about how exactly flight developed in these vertebrates.  Some scientists believe the first fliers were tree-dwelling dinosaurs who could parachute and glide before they could fly, while some say flight grew up from the ground, from runners.

The second International Student Olympiad in Neurosurgery for the prize of the Governor of Tyumen Oblast, Russia took place in the first week of April at the Federal Center for Neurosurgery in Tyumen. The competition was attended by 46 people from cities within Russia as well as from Aktobe, Kazakhstan. Wikinews attended the event, and talked to some of those involved.


This was the second consecutive student Olympiad in neurosurgery. Six of the country's eight federal district capitals were reportedly scheduled to send contestants. The winners are awarded free tuition at the academic department of Neurosurgery at First Moscow State Medical University (First MSMU), also called Sechenov University. 


Madina Bizheva, in her fourth year at Kabardino-Balkarian State University, won this second Olympiad. The other two places at Sechenov University were awarded to Oleg Titov, fifth year at the First MSMU, and Irina Borovikova, fifth year at Ural State Medical University. Bizheva said: ""I give my victory to my mother, who inspired me to study at a neurosurgeon. After she had a stroke, the dream of becoming a doctor began to turn into reality. I was seriously preparing for the Olympiad. One hand rocked the child, the other held a book on neurosurgery. If a person strives for and desires something, then everything will work out."" ((ru))Russian: ‍Свою победу я дарю маме, которая вдохновила меня пойти учится на нейрохирурга. После того, как у нее случился инсульт, мечта стать врачом стала превращаться в реальность. Я серьезно готовилась к олимпиаде. Одной рукой покачивала ребенка, другой держала книгу по нейрохирургии. Если человек к чему стремиться и чего-то очень желает, — все получится.

Contestants came from many parts of Russia and from Kazakhstan. Image: Дмитрий Кошелев.

The chairman of the organizing committee of the Olympiad and the head physician of the center, Albert Sufianov, is also the head of the academic department of neurosurgery in the First MSMU. The three best performers in this contest are awarded the opportunity to study for free in his department in the residency of the Sechenov University.


The event was supported financially by Tyumen Oblast. The new governor of the region, Alexander Moor, during his message to the regional parliamentarians read out on November 22, just offered to diversify the economy, reducing the focus on oil and gas from the third Baku and cultivating medical tourism: ""Now the annual volume of our exports — non-row materials and non-energy — has come close to a billion dollars. In the next year, this must be given priority. And here, too, non-standard approaches will be required, in which trends of various origins will organically merge across the traditional industry nomenclature. For example, it is time to perceive Tyumen medicine as a full-fledged export-oriented industry, while closely associated with the tourism business. Medical tourism is growing rapidly all over the world, and in terms of price and quality, Tyumen is more than competitive — if not on a global scale, then on a scale of the whole continent Eurasia exactly. Here the themes of several national projects intersect at once!"" ((ru))Russian: ‍Сейчас годовой объем нашего экспорта – несырьевого и неэнергетического – вплотную приблизился к миллиарду долларов. В следующем году этот вес надо взять. И тут тоже потребуются нестандартные подходы, в которых поверх традиционной отраслевой номенклатуры органично соединятся тренды различного происхождения. Скажем, тюменскую медицину уже пора воспринимать как полноценную экспортно-ориентированную отрасль, при этом тесно связанную с туристическим бизнесом. Медицинский туризм бурно растет во всем мире, а по параметрам цены и качества Тюмень более чем конкурентоспособна – если не в глобальном масштабе, то в масштабе всего евразийского континента точно. Здесь пересекаются тематики сразу нескольких национальных проектов!

According to Professor Sergey Dydykin, who is both co-chairman of the organizing committee and head of the academic department of operative surgery and topographic anatomy of the First MSMU, in the United States and Europe it is not customary to teach manual skills, such as manual surgical techniques, to undergraduates; conducting surgical competitions for students is a Russian practice.


During the Olympiad, students had to perform simulated practical tasks. For example, in the final part of the competition, the contestants had to mill away the shell of a raw egg without damaging the membranes beneath. This exercise simulates endoscopic drilling.


According to Sufianov, the Olympiad shows young people the ""social elevators"" available to them. He suggesnted student Ibrahim Salamov as an illustration of his words. A year ago, this native of the Dagestan village took first prize, and he is now one of the organizers of the Olympiad. 


Regarding which part of the competition was most difficult for aspiring neurosurgeons, Sufianov said it was English language. From his view, this is a nationwide problem in Russia — there are many skilled surgeons in the country, but their knowledge of foreign languages is not very strong.  In his opinion, a specialist has almost no chance to become a very high level professional without knowledge of English.


Alexander Gagay of Yekaterinburg, who took third place last year, is currently a fourth year student at Ural State Medical University. This year, he said, he came to support his fellow Yekaterinburgers. In his opinion, the most difficult part was the theoretical tasks, and not English. In his view, the federal neurosurgery centers like Tyumen created within the framework of the national health project are on the same level with their foreign counterparts. In his view, there are strong opportunities to become a very good specialist without leaving Russia.


Several people returned to the Olympiad after attending last year. One is Denis Kovalchuk, a sixth year student at Buryat State University. He said he was interested in neurosurgery from the first year, but in his home region there are no suitably equipped facilities as there are in Tyumen. Kovalchuk also said that, after the first Olympiad, a community of young neurosurgeons emerged on social networks, numbering about 400 people. Students exchange professional literature in it and give each other tips for use in practical situations.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Pope_Francis_instructs_reporting_of_sexual_abuse_to_higher_church_authorities,2019-05-12,Pope Francis instructs reporting of sexual abuse to higher church authorities,"Sunday, May 12, 2019 

On Thursday, Pope Francis announced new church law to mandate reporting sexual abuses to the church authorities.  Per the decree signed by the leader of Roman Catholic Christianity, priests and nuns of the Catholic churches are expected to notify the higher church authorities, as a step to act on sexual abuse and its cover-up happening in the churches.


In February, Catholic bishops from around the world attended a summit in Rome, overseen by the Pope, regarding sexual abuse by the clergy in the churches and the congregations.  During the summit, Pope Francis said the victims of sexual abuse in churches had a right to ""concrete and efficient measures"" against the abuse.  Amongst reported incidents of sexual abuse and cover-ups perpetrated by church authorities, recently Cardinal George Pell, a senior Catholic figure at the Holy See, as well as former archbishop and cardinal Theodore McCarrick were convicted for sexually abusing minors.


The decree signed by the Pope read ""The crimes of sexual abuse offend Our Lord; cause physical, psychological and spiritual damage to the victims; and harm the community of the faithful. In order that these phenomena, in all their forms, never happen again, a continuous and profound conversion of hearts is needed, attested by concrete and effective actions that involve everyone in the church, so that personal sanctity and moral commitment can contribute to promoting full credibility of the gospel message and the effectiveness of the church's mission"".


The decree also mentions establishing a system to keep the identity of the victims confidential.  Per numbers reported by The Associated Press, 415 thousand priests and 660 thousand nuns are subject to the requirement to report to the hierarchy misconducts happening in the church by religious leaders.  The decree instructs archbishops to notify the Vatican City of any sexual allegations.  The Vatican is to decide within a month if an investigation is required, and the investigation ordinarily has to be completed in three months.


Cardinal Marc Ouellet of the Holy See said, ""We have said for years that priests should follow certain strict rules, so why should the bishops and other members of the church hierarchy be exempt?""  Vatican archbishop Charles Scicluna said, ""People must know that bishops are at the service of the people.  They are not above the law, and if they do wrong, they must be reported.""


Though Catholic nuns and priests are expected to report the incident of sexual abuse to the authorities, the decree did not mandate filing a report with police officials.  To this, Peter Iseley of worldwide victim group Ending Clergy Abuse said, ""The church should establish the law for reporting and justify the exception [...] Instead, they are using the exception as a pretext for not reporting sexual abuse to civil authorities and to keep abuse secret"".  Iseley also said, ""Bishops reporting to themselves, that's been the problem from the beginning [...] All they did was add another layer of bureaucracy; this doesn't require civil authorities.  What we need are police and prosecutors.""


Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs), another sect of Christianity, also implements a system of reporting abuse internally to a central authority.  Sexual abuse in the religious congregation is reported to the Watch Tower Society, the organisation which directs the JWs on doctrines.  Per the doctrines, testimony of two witnesses is required to convict a person for the alleged crime.  According to a recent report by The Atlantic, the Watch Tower maintains a database of the accused molesters; the Watch Tower has been penalised in various jurisdictions for covering up and protecting alleged sexual abusers.

On Sunday, Polish leader Jarosław Kaczyński of the conservative Law and Justice Party ((pl))Polish language: ‍Prawo i Sprawiedliwość publicly declared intent to impose stricter punishment for child sexual abuse.  Kaczyński said the party was ready with amendments to the penal code for sentencing up to 30-year prison terms for child sexual abuse.


Presently, sexually abusing minors below the age of fifteen can carry a sentence up to twelve years in Polish jurisdiction.  Kaczyński said, ""We prepared changes to the penal code meaning this crime will be punished very severely [...] there will be no suspended sentences, there will be severe penalties, maybe even up to 30 years in prison"".


This announcement comes after the documentary Just don't tell anyone ((pl))Polish language: ‍Tylko nie mów nikomu was released on YouTube on Saturday.  Just don't tell anyone is a documentary by Tomasz and Marek Sekielski, which is about pædophilia among Polish Roman Catholic priests, and the sex abusers being confronted by their victims.  It gathered over eight million views in two days.  There have been numerous complaints about Catholic churches not handling the cases of sexual abuse properly, and even covering up the acts in Poland and around the world.


Speaking about the movie, the topmost senior Polish archbishop Wojciech Polak said, ""I am deeply disturbed by what I saw in Tomasz Sekielski's film.  The enormous suffering of those who have been hurt gives rise to pain and shame [...] I am sorry for every wound inflicted by people of the church.""  Calling it as ""just another apology"", Anna Franowska of ""Have no fear"", an abuse victim support charity, told Reuters ""it almost appears as if the statement was prepared before the church officials saw the movie"".  On Thursday, the leader of Roman Catholic Christianity, Pope Francis, imposed a law mandating Catholic priests and nuns to report cases of sexual abuse in the religious congregation to the higher church authorities.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Actor_Doris_Day_dies_at_97,2019-05-16,Actor Doris Day dies at 97,"Thursday, May 16, 2019 


US singer, actor, and animal rights advocate Doris Day died on Monday at her home in Carmel Valley, California. Day made many studio albums, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and rescued animals from Hurricane Katrina.


Day's animal foundation said she had been in otherwise ""excellent physical health for her age"" but had recently had pneumonia.  Day, they said, desired no memorials or grave markers.


Fashion designer Mary Quant described Day to the BBC in 2002: ""Doris Day was America. Doris Day was everything that was wonderful about America. She was all woman, as well as being the girl next door. She had it all.""


Day was born Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff in Cincinnati, Ohio in the United States in 1922. The daughter of a music teacher, she had early planned on a dancing career but broke her leg in a car-train collision at age 12.  She began singing first on Cincinnati radio and then in clubs.  Reportedly, her name was shortened to ""Doris Day,"" imitating a song called ""Day after Day,"" so it would fit on a sign.


Over the course of her singing career, Day made 29 studio albums and performed live with big bands, such as Les Brown and His Band of Renown.  Day was paid more than any other female singer by 1946.  In film, she was successful in romantic comedies and musicals.


Though she was nominated for the Oscar for the 1959 romantic comedy Pillow Talk, opposite Rock Hudson, Day personally considered her best film performance to be her portrayal of singer Ruth Etting in the James Cagney film Love Me or Leave Me.  She also performed in a film by director Alfred Hitchcock, The Man Who Knew Too Much.


For much of her career, Day presented a very wholesome image.  ""I have the unfortunate reputation of being Miss Goody Two-Shoes, America's Virgin, and all that,"" Day said in her 1976 autobiography, ""so I'm afraid it's going to shock some people for me to say this, but I staunchly believe no two people should get married until they have lived together[.]""


Day made her last movie in 1968 and, with debts left behind after the death of her third husband, hosted The Doris Day Show on television until 1973, at which point she focused her career primarily on animal rights, founding the Doris Day Animal Foundation.


Humane Society executive director Sara Amundson said Day ""founded one of the first national animal protection organizations dedicated to legislative remedies for the worst animal abuse[,]"" which ""led to dozens of bills, final rules and policies on the federal level[.]"" Amundson cited improvements to the treatment of research chimpanzees and the ending of animal abuse videos.


In 1985, Day invited former co-star Hudson, then visibly deteriorating from AIDS, to appear on television together as part of Day's talk show Doris Day's Best Friends.  Although dogs were the purported subject of the episode, Hudson's deterioration became public knowledge; news spread that a star such as Rock Hudson had AIDS, which at the time was highly stigmatized.


When interviewed by the BBC, Day said of Hudson, ""Nothing was ever talked about as far as his private life, I must tell you. Many people would ask me, 'Is Rock Hudson really gay?' and I said, 'It's something that I will not discuss. First of all, I know nothing about his private life, and if I did I wouldn't discuss it, so I can't tell you one thing about him except that he is a nice man.'""


Day had one child, record producer Terry Melcher, with her first husband, musician Al Jorden.  She was also married in turn to George Weidler, Marty Melcher, and Barry Comden, whom she divorced in 1981.  She said Jorden had been physically abusive to her.


In a 2006 interview with magazine The Bark, Day said, ""I've been through everything. I always said I was like those round-bottomed circus dolls — you know, those dolls you could push down and they'd come back up? I've always been like that. I've always said, 'No matter what happens, if I get pushed down, I'm going to come right back up.'""


Day's son, Terry Melcher, predeceased her in 2004.

On Wednesday in the US state of Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey signed the Alabama Human Life Protection Act, officially outlawing nearly all circumstances of abortion in the state. This bill passed the Senate of the state on Tuesday.


Republican state representative Terri Collins who sponsored the bill remarked the bill was not enforceable under the current interpretation of the US Constitution established by the US Supreme Court ruling in the Roe v. Wade case. Terri said the bill would become enforceable after the Supreme Court revisits the case.


Apart from when the mother's life is threatened by the pregnancy, the bill provides for any terminations to potentially result in life sentence penalties.


The bill has sparked controversy and protests. Planned Parenthood, along with the American Civil Liberties Union have announced their plans to oppose the bill by lawsuit.


The governor tweeted her reasoning saying, ""Today, I signed into law the Alabama Human Life Protection Act. To the bill’s many supporters, this legislation stands as a powerful testament to Alabamians’ deeply held belief that every life is precious & that every life is a sacred gift from God.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Taiwan%27s_legislature_first_in_Asia_to_legalize_same-sex_marriage,2019-05-19,Taiwan's legislature first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage,"Sunday, May 19, 2019 


On Friday the legislature of Taiwan, the Legislative Yuan, voted 66 to 27 to legalize same-sex marriage, seven days ahead of the two-year deadline issued by the country's Constitutional Court in 2017. This would make Taiwan the first country in Asia to legally recognize unions between same-sex couples. The law is to take effect late this week.


The Legislative Yuan debated three competing bills, and selected the one posed by the country's cabinet, which used the word ""marriage,"" over the two posed by conservatives, which used the terms ""same-sex family relationship"" and ""same-sex union."" The selected bill does not offer same-sex couples all the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts; there are limits on adoption rights and marriage with foreigners.


Jennifer Lu of Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan said, ""[I]t's still not full marriage rights; we still need to fight for co-adoption rights, and we are not sure about foreigner and Taiwanese marriage, and also gender equality education.""


The Taiwanese government held a referendum in November 2018, allowing the population to vote on same-sex marriage, and 67% came out against.


Xiaogang Wei of the Beijing Gender Health Education Institute commented on the Legislative Yuan's decision: ""The Chinese government has pointed to cultural tradition as a reason for same-sex marriage being unsuitable in China. But the decision in Taiwan, which shares a cultural tradition with us, proves that Chinese culture can be open, diverse and progressive.""


In mainland China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan, homosexuality is technically not illegal, but late last year a same-sex erotica author was sentenced to ten years in prison, and same-sex marriage is not recognized.


In 2017, Taiwan's Constitutional Court, which rules on constitutional matters, said not allowing gay citizens to marry constituted ""different treatment"" incompatible with the constitution. The decision prompted objections from conservatives opposing recognition of gay marriage.

Many thousands of anime and manga fans descended on the Toronto Congress Centre for Anime North, a fan-run convention launched in 1997. Spread between four venues over three days, May 24 to 26, the event featured J-pop maid idols, voice actors, writers, and more. Wikinews attended.


Despite the ample indoor spaces, the parking lot of the Centre is also a hub of activity, with cosplayers posing for photos. Attendees were sent running for cover on Saturday, as heavy rains and a severe thunderstorm warning put a damper on festivities.


The event is organized by a massive team of volunteers, and known for its specialized programming for fans, by fans. On the night of May 25, for example, attendees could catch ""Pokemon Biology"", ""Kimono Obi Tying"", and ""Underappreciated Sports Anime/Manga.""


US voice actor Alexis Tipton marveled at the growth of the anime industry in the last decade. ""Back when I was going as a fan, there wasn't as much anime, so it was easier to know about everything,"" Tipton observed during a question and answer session. ""I'm so overwhelmed by how much there is.""


Tipton held a panel on her career, dubbing anime for US distribution company Funimation Entertainment. While many anime voice actors weren't fans going into the industry, Tipton recalled going to anime conventions with her friends during middle school and high school. Once she was an invited guest, Tipton recalls realizing ""oh, I'm not here to just have fun, I'm here to work; I have a set schedule and I can't just, like, you know, go do what I want.""


Early in her career, Tipton was cast as a voice for My Bride is a Mermaid, a role that required singing. Then just 19 years old, she looked at the role as a ""chance to face my demons,"" having questioned her abilities for years. ""I was in an extremely competitive [singing musical theatre] program in high school. I had started working at Funimation when I was 19, so I was just barely in college.

At around 12:20 p.m. local time on Wednesday (1620 UTC) in the United States capital city Washington DC, Arnav Gupta, 33-year-old of Bethesda, Maryland, set himself on fire in a publicly accessible area called the Ellipse, between the south lawn of the White House and the Washington Monument. Gupta was transported to a local hospital and originally listed in critical condition, according to officials, with burns over reportedly 85% of his body. He died that night.


Emergency responders included the Secret Service and US Park Police. Responders drove their vehicles onto the Ellipse where an officer used a fire extinguisher to put out the flames. The Secret Service confirmed a single male was transported to a local hospital and the response took place within seconds.


On Wednesday morning Gupta's family members filed a missing persons report, according to the Montgomery County Police Department.


Tourists captured pictures and video of the incident. Once the white extinguisher smoked cleared the man had collapsed. Surrounding areas were reportedly shut down. As of Thursday, no official statement had been made on the man's motivation.


Gupta's self-immolation follows another attempt in April where a wheelchair-using individual attempted to set his jacket on fire along the north lawn fence line.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/U.S._heiress,_designer,_and_author_Gloria_Vanderbilt_dies_at_95",2019-06-20,"U.S. heiress, designer, and author Gloria Vanderbilt dies at 95","Thursday, June 20, 2019 


U.S. heiress Gloria Vanderbilt died on Monday at the age of 95, her son Anderson Cooper announced.  She had advanced stomach cancer.  Scion of the wealthy Vanderbilt family and the subject of a heavily publicized custody battle early in life, she later also became a performer, artist, and designer of porcelain, linens, and a well-known line of designer jeans.


Anderson Cooper, of CNN, one of Vanderbilt's four sons, stated, ""Gloria Vanderbilt was an extraordinary woman, who loved life, and lived it on her own terms [...] She was a painter, a writer, and designer but also a remarkable mother, wife, and friend. She was 95 years old, but ask anyone close to her, and they'd tell you, she was the youngest person they knew, the coolest, and most modern.""


Vanderbilt was born in 1924 into the wealthy Vanderbilt family, great-great granddaughter of the railroad and shipping tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt.  Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, died with liver disease when she was one.  At the age of ten, Vanderbilt was the subject of a heavily publicized custody battle between her widowed mother, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and her aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who controlled a large piece of the Vanderbilt fortune.  Her aunt won.


Although she had a trust fund worth US$5 million that she shared with one half-sister, over the course of her life, Vanderbilt also earned income herself through various pursuits.  Encouraged to explore creative outlets by a psychotherapist, Vanderbilt took acting lessons and eventually performed on stage in The Time of Your Life in 1955 and appeared on television programs.  She also focused on art and design, creating paintings, collages, linens, and a brand of designer jeans that would generate millions in sales. In 1990, the Smithsonian museum featured her jeans alongside the works of designers including Coco Chanel in an exhibit on gender and style.


Syracuse University pop culture professor Robert Thompson remarked, ""The thing that really made Gloria Vanderbilt penetrate the American consciousness was the blue jeans war of the late '70s and early 1980s [...] The jeans moved from being functional clothes to designer jeans [...] it was her attempt to take something that was so unglamorous and invest it in high fashion style.""


Vanderbilt was married to talent agent Pasquale ""Pat"" Di Cicco; conductor Leopold Stokowski, who fathered two of her sons; director Sidney Lumet; and author Wyatt Cooper; but, according to her memoirs, also had some degree of romantic involvement with, amongst others, Errol Flynn, Frank Sinatra, and Marlon Brando.  She would later say her union with Cooper was her only happy marriage.


Vanderbilt also authored several books, including the memoirs Once Upon a Time and Black Knight, White Knight and the 2009 novel Obsession, which the New York Times called ""the steamiest book ever written by an octogenarian.""


Vanderbilt is survived by two sons with Stokowski, Stanislaus and Christopher, and by her son Anderson Cooper.  Another son, Carter Cooper, predeceased her.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Hong_Kong_protesters_surround_downtown_police_complex,2019-06-23,Hong Kong protesters surround downtown police complex,"Sunday, June 23, 2019  


On Friday, thousands of Hong Kong protesters wearing black clothes, face masks, and helmets gathered around Hong Kong's principal police complex, blocking the exits as they chanted slogans and threw eggs. This comes after weeks of protests against a proposed change to Hong Kong's extradition law that would allow the Chinese government to remove people who had been accused of crimes from Hong Kong to the mainland.


The protest began outside the Legislative Council Complex but later moved a few blocks to the Hong Kong Police Headquarters, with some protesters heading for Revenue Tower instead.


The bill in question would allow people living in or visiting Hong Kong, including fugitives, to be removed to mainland China and subjected to its legal system, which the BBC describes as ""marred by allegations of torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detentions.""


The bill was suspended after last week's protests, one of which drew two million people. Hong Kong student groups had given the government until Thursday to throw it out entirely, but this deadline was not met.


Protesters' demands include investigation of alleged police violence against protesters on June 12, the release and dropping of charges against protesters who were arrested, that the government cease referring to the protests as ""riots,"" and complete dismissal of the extradition bill. They had asked Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who is supported by the mainland Chinese government, to resign from her position, but this has been dropped from the list of demands. Legal and religious groups have also called for the bill to be dropped.


The British relinquished control of Hong Kong to China in 1997. Since then, the territory has been governed under the ""one country, two systems"" model, meaning the Chinese government has allowed Hong Kong citizens more freedom than people in the rest of the country. Specifically, Hong Kong has its own legislature, justice system and remains under a capitalist economic system.

On Friday, on Route 2 in Randolph, New Hampshire, United States, a pickup truck and a group of ten motorcycles collided, the truck catching fire in the process. The incident left seven motorcyclists dead; the official cause of death reportedly was ""blunt trauma.""  The victims were reportedly members and supporters of the motorcycle club Marine JarHeads MC, which includes both veterans of the United States Marines and their spouses.


According to Coös County Attorney John McCormick on Saturday, the truck driver was identified as commercial driver Volodoymyr Zhukovskyy. The pickup had been towing a flatbed trailer.  The deceased victims were officially identified as Michael Ferazzi, Albert Mazza, Desma Oakes, Aaron Perry, Daniel Pereira, and Joanne and Edward Corr. Three other cyclists were hospitalized.


After the names of the victims were released, New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu declared flags would be flown at half-mast on Monday — today — in their honor. A memorial was held for the group as part of a Blessing of the Bikes ceremony this weekend in Columbia, New Hampshire. Marine Corps and United States flags were also left at and near the scene of the crash.  As of Saturday the crash was being investigated by both state police and the National Transportation Safety Board, and as of yesterday no arrests nor charges were reported. A GoFundMe campaign has been set up to pay for funeral costs and medical expenses.

Acting via his lawyers, Volodoymyr Zhukovskyy, 23, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to seven counts of negligent homicide in New Hampshire, United States.  Zhukovskyy waived arraignment and did not physically appear in court. According to police and county officials, Zhukovskyy was driving a pickup truck ""erratically and across the double-yellow center line"" on U.S. Route 2 in Randolph, New Hampshire on the night of June 21 and struck a group of motorcycles, killing seven riders and injuring three more.


Travis Hood, who witnessed the collision, said ""I don't really don't know what he was doing [...] The truck pretty much was like in the middle of the yellow line, and the guy pretty much cleaned out the whole — the bikes were riding side-by-side, and the guy cleaned out pretty much every bike that was there besides one of them.""


Zhukovskyy was arrested Monday at his home in the neighboring state of Massachusetts and waived extradition to New Hampshire.


According to police in Baytown, Texas, Zhukovskyy has been involved in traffic collisions before. Reportedly, he struck a guard rail on June 3 and flipped the Mack truck he had been driving on its side.  According to investigators, Zhukovskyy said he had over-corrected after being cut off by another driver, and he was not cited for the incident.  The Associated Press reports Zhukovskyy has also been stopped for suspicion of driving while inebriated.


The court determined Zhukovskyy's driving history rendered him a danger to himself or to the public. For this reason, he was not granted bail. His trial has been scheduled for November.

On Friday, United States Federal District Judge Michael Urbanski sentenced Ohio man James Alex Fields, now 22, to life in prison without the possibility of parole for driving his car into a crowd of people who were counter-protesting against white supremacists attending the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. 


In that event, Fields, a self-described Neo-Nazi, killed a woman named Heather Heyer and injured at least nineteen others.


The hearings and motions leading up to the announcement included video footage of the collision between Fields' car and the crowd, testimony from eyewitnesses, an apology from Fields, and requests for leniency from Fields' lawyers, who argued his history of mental illness.


Last March, Fields made an arrangement with prosecutors to plead guilty to 29 out of 30 federal hate crime charges on condition they would not seek the death penalty. Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother, told reporters she considered the deal acceptable, saying executing Fields would not bring her daughter back.


The Unite the Right rally drew national attention within the United States partly because President Donald Trump claimed there were ""fine people on both sides,"" meaning both the white supremacists and the counter-protesters, for which he was criticized.


This sentence applies to the federal charges against Fields, those issued by the United States' central government. He has already been found guilty of criminal charges under the laws of the State of Virginia, with a jury-recommended sentence of life plus 419 years and fines of nearly half a million US dollars.  State sentencing has been scheduled for July.

On Friday, Youssef Chahed, the Prime Minister of Tunisia, signed a government decree banning anyone wearing a niqab from entering a public institution or government offices.  A niqab is a face-veil, which covers almost the entire face, and is commonly worn by Muslim females as a religious garment.


""Chahed signed a government decree that bars any person with an undisclosed face from access to public headquarters, administrations, institutions, for security reasons"", a government official said.  This decision comes after a couple of suicide bombings took place in the country's capital, Tunis, last month.  Reportedly, two people were killed and at least eight people were injured in a suicide bombing that happened on June 27.  According to eyewitness reports, the suicide bomber wore a face veil covering, the niqab.  In the span of one week, at least three suicide bombings took place in Tunisia.  The militant organisation, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, claimed responsibility for all three attacks.


Speaking to Agence France-Presse, the president of the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights, Jamel Msallem, said, ""We are for the freedom to dress, but today with the current situation and the terrorist threats in Tunisia and across the region we find justifications for this decision"".  A member of the Tunisian Parliament, Samir Dilou said, ""Tunisia is facing terrorist attacks, so every measure which is led by security motives is understandable"".


After an attack in the capital city in 2015, a bill was proposed in 2016 for banning the niqab, but was not passed.  Souhail Alouini, a member of Parliament, said, ""We proposed a bill in 2016 about this subject and it has still not been debated [...] Maybe it is time now.""


Tunisia's neighbouring Muslim-majority African countries including Algeria and Morocco have cited security concerns to impose bans on niqabs.  Previously, another Islamic religious garment, the hijab, was banned in Tunisian public offices during Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's Presidency.  That ban was lifted in 2011.

Leaders of African Union (AU) member states met in Niamey, Niger's capital, for an AU summit where on Sunday Presidents Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria and Patrice Talon of Benin signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement.


Nigeria previously announced it planned to join the AfCFTA in the week leading up to the summit. AU trade and industry commissioner Albert Muchanga announced Benin was to join. The commissioner said, ""We haven't yet agreed on rules of origin and tariff con[c]essions, but the framework we have is enough to start trading on July 1, 2020"".


Niger's president Mahamadou Issoufou said, ""Nigeria is Africa's biggest economy and most populous country. Without Nigeria the free trade zone would've been handicapped.""


The agreement seeks to remove tariffs on 90 percent of commodities and better intregrate African economies.


At the opening of the AU summit, AU chairperson President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt said, ""The success of the AfCFTA will be the real test to achieve the economic growth that will turn our people's dream of welfare and quality of life into a reality"".


With Sunday's signings, all but one of the member states of the 55-member AU have signed on to the agreement, with Eritrea the only state unsigned. African leaders have negotiated the deal over the last four years. While 54 nations have signed onto the AfCFTA, only 27 have ratified the agreement.


While many transactions in Africa occur using U.S. dollars or euros, the AU announced an electronic pan-African payment system.
African Export–Import Bank president Okey Oramah said the use of third-party currencies ""costs Africa between $5 and $7 billion,"" further saying, ""Beyond that, it also reduces trade because Africa has a scarcity of foreign exchange.""


There are reportedly 1.3 billion people in the free trade area, with the combined economies of the countries worth US$3.4 trillion. One of the stated goals of AfCFTA is to encourage more intra-Africa trade. Currently about 16–17 percent of African trade occurs between African countries. This is in contrast to the European Union members, where intra-European trade accounts for over 60 percent of trade.


The International Monetary Fund said in May the AfCFTA might be for African countries comparable to the European and North American trade blocs as an ""economic game changer"".


Seven members states had bid to host the AfCFTA secretariat, the operational organ of the free trade agreement, with Ghana winning the bid.

The governor of Louisiana, a U.S. state on the Gulf of Mexico, declared a state of emergency for the state on Thursday, with Tropical Storm Barry approaching the coast.


Governor John Bel Edwards addressed the public: ""No one should take this storm lightly. As we know all too well in Louisiana, low intensity does not necessarily mean low impact."" He said he has arranged for 3000 of the National Guard to be available and has search and rescue teams at the ready and has requested U.S. President Donald Trump declare a state of emergency in Lousiana on the federal level.


The mayor of New Orleans, LaToya Cantrell, advised residents of her city to make plans and shelter in place.  Residents of some other areas, such as Jefferson Parish, have been instructed to evacuate.


According to the United States National Hurricane Center, Tropical Storm Barry could develop into a hurricane as soon as Friday.  Meteorologists predict landfall Saturday morning.


Although its winds are only predicted to reach about 75 miles per hour (120 kph), the National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning covering an area from Gulfport, Mississippi, to New Orleans and other forecasters predicted a storm surge of three to six feet (one to two meters).


As of midday Thursday, the storm was about 90 miles (145 km) south of the coast and moving at roughly five miles per hour (eight kilometers per hour).


The city of New Orleans already sustained heavy rains earlier this week, with flooding.  New Orleans and Jefferson Parish officials have said they are not concerned about the levees, which have about five or six feet of leeway for rising water.

Governor Alexander Pimentel told CNN Philippines the towns damaged were primarily Carrascal, Cantilan, Madrid, Carmen, Lanuza, and Cortes.


According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), the epicenter was located roughly nine kilometers (about six miles) east of Carrascal, 73 km (45 miles) north of Tandag City, the capital of Surigao del Sur. Phivolcs reported the earthquake's magnitude was 5.5; United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported 5.8.


Madrid District Hospital in the town of Madrid, which sustained cracks on concrete walls with some pieces falling to the ground, treated 25 wounded people who evacuated to the hospital, CNN Philippines reported the governor said.

John Paul Stevens, a former associate justice of the US Supreme Court, died yesterday at the age of 99, according to a statement released by the Supreme Court. Stevens died in the evening with his two daughters at his bedside at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The statement ascribed his death to complications from a stroke on Monday.


Stevens was born in 1920 in Chicago, Illinois and studied law at Northwestern University. He was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1975 by President Gerald Ford. Among the most famous opinions written by Stevens was his dissent in the Court's decision to halt Florida recounts in the 2000 US Presidential election, the decision that cemented George W. Bush's victory over Al Gore. Stevens retired from the court in 2010.


""On behalf of the Court and retired Justices,"" wrote Chief Justice John G. Roberts, ""I am saddened to report that our colleague Justice John Paul Stevens has passed away. A son of the Midwest heartland and a veteran of World War II, Justice Stevens devoted his long life to public service, including 35 years on the Supreme Court. He brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom, and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation. We extend our deepest condolences to his children Elizabeth and Susan, and to his extended family"".

The United States House of Representatives voted to hold two current Cabinet officers, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Attorney General William Barr, in contempt of Congress, citing their refusal to disclose to Congress documents related to President Donald Trump's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The vote passed primarily along party lines, 230-to-198. Historically, the Department of Justice has not pursued criminal charges against those held in contempt of Congress.


In April, the House Oversight and Reform Committee authorized subpoenas for documents relating to the administration's decision to try to add a question about citizenship to the census, attempting to discern the true reason for the addition of the citizenship question. Barr and Ross, however, refused to hand over the documents. On June 12, minutes before the Oversight Committee voted to refer them to the full House to be held in contempt, Trump formally claimed the documents were subject to executive privilege.


For weeks, the Trump administration has been trying to add the question, ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?"", to the upcoming 2020 census, with the stated rationale of improving enforcement of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In late June, the United States Supreme Court ruled against its initial attempt, saying the justification presented for the question was ""contrived."" A few days later, on July 2, Trump announced he would drop his bid to add the question, before reversing course the next day and pressing forward. A few days later the administration said he would use an executive order to add the citizenship question to the census, disregarding the Supreme Court's ruling. The administration finally gave up on July 11, arranging instead to provide citizenship information to the Census Bureau from other government agencies.


Only once before has Congress voted to hold a Cabinet officer in contempt while they were in office: Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt in 2012 for refusing to turn over documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. People held in contempt of Congress are referred to the Department of Justice for potential criminal prosecution. As Attorney General, Barr leads the Department of Justice. Kerri Kupec, spokeswoman for the Trump administration's Department of Justice, sharply criticized the House's decision, which Ross has referred to as ""gamesmanship"" and a ""stunt"".


The citizenship question was last included in the general census in 1950.

Early Saturday morning, somewhat after midnight, police in Clairton, Pennsylvania, in the eastern United States, responded to multiple reports of a shooting at a graduation party. Police said over a hundred people attended the party, located in Allegheny County, four of whom were injured in the shooting.


The injured teenagers, three girls and a boy between the ages of 14 and 18, were hospitalized. As of Sunday evening, all four are in stable condition, and no fatalities have emerged from the shooting. The victims have not been identified. 


The backyard party took place at 619 Waddell Avenue, near the local high school. Neighbors told CBS station KDKA-TV that the area is usually quiet. Party-goers still at the scene after the shooting fled when police arrived, according to county police. The police do not have a suspect yet, and the motive remains unknown.

Tropical Depression Three formed over the Bahamas this weekend, before heading towards Florida. As of Monday evening, the National Hurricane Center reported the depression had sustained winds of 30 miles per hour (45 kilometers per hour), just nine shy of becoming a tropical storm. If it strengthened, it would be named Tropical Storm Chantal. On Tuesday, however, they reported the depression dissipated off the coast of Florida.


A ""tropical depression"" is a form of tropical cyclone. On the scale used by the NHC for classifying tropical cyclones, a ""tropical depression"" is the weakest form of tropical cyclone.


When it was first detected on Sunday, the depression was given only a one-in-five chance of becoming a tropical storm. By Monday afternoon, this likelihood had risen to a three-in-five chance. If named, it would have become the third named storm of the 2019 Atlantic storm season.


The National Hurricane Center's 5 p.m. update on Monday had the depression 120 miles (195 km) southeast of Florida's West Palm Beach, moving northwest at 13 mph (20 km/h). It was forecast to reach Florida possibly on Wednesday. By Tuesday morning, the storm had dissipated, with an Air Force Reserve survey finding the storm no longer qualified as a ""Tropical Depression"" because it didn't exhibit closed circulation near ground level.

Conservative Party members voted on Tuesday to elect Boris Johnson — former Foreign Secretary, mayor of London, and member of Parliament — as the new Conservative leader. Current Prime Minister Theresa May is to step down today, with Johnson succeeding her as the Prime Minister of Great Britain.


Johnson competed for the role against Jeremy Hunt, who succeeded him as Foreign Secretary, the United Kingdom's chief diplomat. He won with 92,153 votes, out of roughly 160,000 members of the Conservative Party that were eligible to vote. In his victory speech, Johnson stressed his support for the Brexit movement, and reiterated that he plans on leaving the European Union even if no agreement has been reached regarding future relations. Parliament, however, has repeatedly voted against a ""no deal"" Brexit.


Johnson first entered politics when elected in 2001 as a member of Parliament. He then served eight years as the mayor of London, from 2008 to 2016, before rejoining Parliament. Following the UK's Brexit vote, Theresa May appointed him Foreign Secretary, which he served as until 2018, resigning in protest to May's negotiated Brexit agreement.


Citizens of the United Kingdom do not elect the Prime Minister directly. Rather, the official leader of the party with the most seats in Parliament is appointed Prime Minister by the King or Queen, currently Queen Elizabeth II. In this way, the British Prime Minister is elected indirectly, as the people vote for their members of Parliament.

Ricardo Rosselló Nevares, Puerto Rico's governor, announced his resignation shortly before midnight Wednesday night in an internet video broadcast to the U.S. island territory. Rosselló said he is to leave office next month on August 2 at 5 p.m. local time (2100 UTC). His announcement followed two weeks of protests in the capital, San Juan, over offensive messages about public officials and others.


In his resignation speech, Rosselló said, ""Despite having the democratic mandate of the people who elected me, today I feel that to continue in this position represents difficulty in allowing achieved success to endure."" ((es))Spanish language: ‍A pesar de contar con el mandato del pueblo que democráticamente me eligió, hoy siento que continuar en esta posición representa una dificultad para que el éxito alcanzado perdure.

Protesters called for Rosselló's resignation after revelations he and his staffers sent anti-homosexual and misogynistic comments using Telegram, a messaging app. The Puerto Rico Center for Investigative Journalism obtained the Telegram messages between Rosselló and eleven others and released them publicly on July 13. Messages disparaged a variety of public figures and Hurricane Maria victims. Since the release of the text messages, protests filled the San Juan streets daily.


Rosselló is set to be replaced by Wanda Vázquez Garced, the Secretary of Justice for Puerto Rico. According to the commonwealth's constitution, the Secretary of State would normally succeed the governor, but that office stands vacant following the resignation of Luis Rivera Marín over the scandal.


In a statement, Vázquez said, ""I understand he made the right decision, for the good of both his family and for Puerto Rico, as I let him know [...] He just announced that this resignation will not be effective today. We will be working together to have a responsible and transparent transition process.""


Ricardo Llerandi, Rosselló's chief of staff, also announced his resignation effective next Wednesday, July 31.


Rosselló began serving as Puerto Rico's eleventh governor on January 2, 2017. In addition to stepping down as governor, Rosselló announced he would resign leadership of the New Progressive Party.

On Friday, Ricardo Rosselló Nevares resigned as the governor of United States commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Pedro Pierluisi was sworn in at 5 p.m. local time (2100 UTC) as Puerto Rico's new governor. The Puerto Rican constitution stipulates the secretary of state succeeds to the governorship following a vacancy, but the post remained unfilled until Pierluisi was appointed to the position.


The exiting governor Rosselló appointed Pierluisi as secretary of state. Earlier on Friday, the commonwealth's House of Representatives confirmed him, but the Senate had not confirmed him. The constitution requires both houses of the Legislative Assembly to confirm nominees. 


Pierluisi said from LA Fortaleza's Hall of Mirrors, ""If the Senate confirms me, I will be governor until 2020. If the Senates does not confirm me, I will be governor until next Wednesday."" ((es))Spanish language: ‍Si el Senado me ratifica, seré gobernador hasta el 2020. Si el Senado no me ratifica, seré gobernador hasta el próximo miércoles The Senate was set to meet on Wednesday, but at nearly the same time as Pierluisi's comments, the Senate announced it would meet on Monday.


Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz expressed opposition to the swearing-in of Pierluisi, and suggested there were not enough votes in the Senate for his confirmation. One senator, Eduardo Bhatia, said he intended to sue over the controversy.  Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of the capitol city of San Juan, said she would challenge Pierluisi's oath of office in court.


Secretary of Justice Wanda Vázquez Garced, the would-be successor should Pierluisi remain unconfirmed by the Senate, has expressed she is uninterested in taking up the office of governor but would do so if she did succeed to it, according to Reuters.


Pierluisi is the former Puerto Rican non-voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. While Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States, it is not a state and does not get representation in the U.S. Senate, a vote in the U.S. House, nor any vote in the U.S. Electoral College that elects the U.S. President.

Wikinews attended the Texas Haunters Convention on the last weekend of July — July 27–28 — in Mesquite, Texas. The event was held at the Mesquite Convention Center and spanned roughly 35,000 square feet of exhibit and classroom space. Halloween-themed, the event was focused on equipment, techniques, props and costumes used in haunted attractions and home haunts. 


A children's costume contest was held each day, with an array of characters and monsters featured.



An array of classes were on offer, one of which allowed attendees to make a faux shrunken head. In a separate class, instructors taught attendees how to build a 'bubbler' prop, as might be displayed in a spooky laboratory scene. 

 Other classes included:


YouTube personality Mr. CreepyPasta was on hand and did a reading of scary stories. Belly dancing troupe Tribal Evolution performed on Saturday and again that evening at the adults-only Costume Ball.



Local actor and producer Joshua Winch was on hand offering DVD's of his films and promo photos and posters. Winch told Wikinews he began acting in theater 20 years ago and also worked on several film projects as a Production Assistant. Ultimately, he began producing film projects writers would present to him in 2004. Winch said he has produced a great deal of horror-comedy films, but grew tired of reading reviews that his films weren't horror because they had comedic elements. He then approached a director and said, ""I want you to make a pure horror movie."" The result was his recent film, Fall of Grace. Winch said the film has been screened at 14 film festivals and he was named Best Actor at one of those events.  

 
More than 70 vendors were present at the event, coming from various parts of the U.S., including California and Florida. A mobile escape room was onsite and allowed playthroughs for VIP attendees.

This Sunday, French inventor Franky Zapata successfully crossed the English Channel on a jet-powered freeflight flying device propelled by turbines and attached to his feet, called Flyboard Air. The 22-mile (35-km) journey took 22 minutes with one refueling about halfway to Dover, England. This success came on the second attempt by the inventor to cross the Channel. This device was invented three years ago and could reportedly serve military assault or logistics purposes.


The flight started at 8:17 a.m. local time (0617 UTC) in Sangatte and finished in St Margaret's at Cliffe near Dover. Zapata flew across the water at over 100 mph (161 km/h). The inventor carried a backpack with kerosene (paraffin} and was escorted by three helicopters. Zapata also made one landing on a boat mid-channel to refill the kerosene fuel in his backpack, a process Zapata described as being tricky because the boat could not be kept still in the moving waters of the Channel.


""Once I managed to stick my heels into the boat, I knew I had done 90% of the work,"" Zapata told French news channel BFM TV.


Strong winds over the Channel presented difficulty during the crossing, Zapata said, adding it required much endurance to manage to stay airborne. ""It's an isometric exercise for the thighs, so it burns — it's quite hard.""


Upon arrival, Zapata told reporters, ""We made a machine three years ago... and now we've crossed the Channel, it's crazy.""


This was Zapata's second attempt to cross the Channel on the Flyboard Air.  On July 25, which was the 110th anniversary of the first plane flight across the Channel by pilot Louis Blériot, Zapata fell into the water after a low-speed collision with the resupply boat.


The inventor previously presented the device at the Bastille Day military parade earlier this year. In that instance, he had been holding a rifle in his hands to show the invention could be utilized for military purposes.


Franky Zapata also invented the original Flyboard, which is propelled by jets of water drawn up by a hose, unlike the Flyboard Air, which uses jets of air.

On Saturday morning, a gunman shot shoppers at a Walmart store in the U.S. border city of El Paso, Texas, with the death toll rising to 22 people on Monday, reported officials, with 25 others injured. Police said the suspected gunman surrendered himself to police after being confronted by officers.  The shooting began at 10:39 a.m. local time (1639 UTC), according to police, who said officers arrived at the Walmart six minutes later.


State prosecutors charged the suspect in the shooting with capital murder, they said Sunday — murder carrying the possibility of the death penalty. 


Federal authorities are investigating the shooting as domestic terrorism, according to prosecutor Josh Bash, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas. Bash characterized the attack as ""designed to intimidate a civilian population, to say the least.""


""We are treating it as a domestic terrorism case, and we're going to do what we do to terrorists in this country, which is deliver swift and certain justice,"" said Bash. Charges of domestic terrorism also carry a possible death penalty at the federal level.


The Walmart, by the Cielo Vista Mall, where the shooting happened is roughly five miles (eight kilometers) from the U.S.–Mexico border crossing between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, separated by the Rio Grande.


According to Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, six Mexican nationals were killed in the attack, and seven more were injured.  Another report from the Mexican government during the weekend said eight Mexicans died in the attack.  Mexico's Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said the Mexican government would pressure the U.S. government to provide better protections for Mexicans in the United States.


The foreign minister said Mexico would consider charging the gunman with terrorism against Mexicans and would seek to extradite the gunman to face charges in Mexico. Ebrard said, ""As far as I know, this would be the first case of this type in history"", adding, ""For Mexico, this individual is a terrorist"".


U.S. officials identified the suspect as 21-year-old Patrick Crusius of Allen, Texas, near the city of Dallas.


According to the El Paso mayor, Dee Margo, during the weekend, police were investigating whether a manifesto posted online to the message board 8chan was written by the suspect. In the document, the writer supposes a ""cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion"" of Hispanic people into the United States.


According to U.S. Attorney Bash, the manifesto if written by the suspect could strengthen the federal government's case: ""The key factor here is that it appears to be an intent to coerce or intimidate a civilian population[...] That's met here.""


El Paso's police chief Greg Allen said late Sunday the police were attributing authorship of the document to Crusius.


According to data from the Gun Violence Archive, the shooting followed four deadly mass shootings in the United States that week, including one in California at a garlic festival in Gilroy, killing three, and another in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin where at least five died. The El Paso shooting preceded another one less than thirteen hours later in Dayton, Ohio where ten people died. The archive characterizes events where four or more people are killed or injured by gunfire, other than the perpetrator, as a mass shooting.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico issued a ruling finding in favor of a lawsuit filed by the Puerto Rico Senate on Sunday against Pedro Pierluisi over his claim to the governorship.  Pierluisi was sworn in last week following the August 2 resignation of Governor Ricardo Rosselló Nevares due to a texting scandal. Following the ruling, Secretary of Justice Wanda Vázquez Garced was sworn in as Puerto Rico's governor at 5:00 p.m. (2100 UTC) in the Supreme Court.


The opinion of the Court, released on Wednesday, read in part, ""[I]t is concluded that the oath of office as governor of the Honorable Pedro R. Pierluisi Urrutia, secretary of state nominated during [an  Assembly] recess, is unconstitutional[...] Pierluisi Urrutia can no longer continue in the position of governor as of the moment in which this opinion and ruling is effective[.]"" ((es))Spanish language: ‍[S]e concluye que la juramentación como gobernador del honorable Pedro R. Pierluisi Urrutia, secretario de Estado nombrado en receso, es inconstitucional[...] Pierluisi Urrutia no puede continuar en el cargo del gobernador a partir del momento en que esta opinión y sentencia sea efectiva

Governor Vázquez had previously stated she was uninterested in taking up the governorship, but would fill the position as needed. In a statement posted to her Twitter account before being sworn in, then-Secretary Vázquez affirmed her willingness to accept the role, writing, ""Puerto Rico needs certainty and stability. Our actions will be directed at that purpose and will always be first"" ((es))Spanish language: ‍Puerto Rico necesita certeza y estabilidad. Nuestras acciones estarán dirigidas a ese fin y siempre estará primero.


The now-former governor Pierluisi was sworn in as governor on August 2 following Rosselló's resignation. Before resigning, Rosselló appointed Pierluisi as secretary of state, the position which becomes the successor to the governorship following vacancy. The Puerto Rican constitution requires consent from both houses of the Legislative Assembly to confirm a candidate for secretary of state.


While the House of Representatives confirmed Pierluisi's nomination on Friday, the Senate did not. Pierluisi stated he would leave the governorship if the Senate voted against confirming him. By Sunday afternoon, Pierluisi said the Senate had no say in his confirmation since there was no longer a secretary of state, and that the courts should decide who holds the governorship.


The Senate was to meet Monday to discuss Pierluisi's confirmation. Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz filed the lawsuit against Pierliusi on behalf of the Senate late Sunday night. According to a memo posted online by Senator Juan Dalmau, the Senate cancelled its planned hearing because Pierluisi did ""...not recongnize the authority of the Puerto Rico Senate to address the [matter]."" ((es))Spanish language: ‍...no reconoce la facultad del Senado de Puerto Rico para atendar la misma

In finding Pierluisi was improperly sworn in as governor, the Supreme Court also found unconstitutional a 2005 law permitting an appointee as secretary of state to succeed to the governorship without the constitutionally required consent of both legislative houses.


Governor Vázquez was appointed by Rosselló as his secretary of justice in 2017 and served in that position until she became governor. She belongs to the ruling New Progressive Party, which advocates Puerto Rico becoming a state within the United States. Puerto Rico is currently an unincorporated commonwealth territory of the United States. Pierluisi, Rivera Schatz, and Rosselló are all members of the New Progressive Party.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Scientists_report_two_life-saving_treatments_for_Ebola,2019-08-15,Scientists report two life-saving treatments for Ebola,"Thursday, August 15, 2019 


On Monday morning, Director Anthony Fauci of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), announced a trial of four possible Ebola drugs was stopped early because two of them had already shown considerable progress in treating the disease and saving the lives of those infected. Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate and spreads via human-to-human contact.


The PALM trial, for the Swahili phrase pamoja tulinde maisha or ""together save lives,"" began last November and collected data from 499 patients from the towns of Beni, Butembo, Mangina, and Katwa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has suffered an Ebola outbreak for roughly the past year.


Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, Director General of the DRC's Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale that monitored the trial, said, ""From now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is incurable[.]"" He went on to say thousands of deaths could be prevented.


While one experimental vaccine appears able to reduce Ebola mortality, up until now, no drugs have been clearly demonstrated suitable for treating existing infection.  One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicated it had less benefit than sought in preventing death.  In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments to it.


The other three treatments were remdesivir, an antiviral drug; mAb114, a monoclonal antibody first isolated from human survivors of an outbreak in Kikwit in 1995, now produced by the Florida company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics; and REGN-EB3, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies from Ebola-infected laboratory mice whose immune systems had been altered to be similar to humans'.


The overall mortality rates were 49% for patients treated with ZMapp, 53% for remdesivir, 29% for REGN-EB3, and 34% for mAb114, but patients treatment early with low viral loads had a death rate of only 6% to 11% when treated with REGN-EB3 or mAb114.


Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization (WHO) told the press the new drugs were only part of the solution: ""What will stop Ebola, under professor Muyembe's leadership and that of the government of the DRC, is good surveillance, good infection prevention and control, good community engagement, excellent vaccinations, and the use of these therapeutics in the most effective way possible.""


Past EVD outbreak mortality rates have been at least 25%, as high as 90%, and averaged around 50% according to WHO's statistics. According to Muyembe, many people do not seek treatment because they see their friends and relatives die after entering a care facility. ""Now that 90% of their patients can go into the treatment center and come out completely cured,"" he told the press, ""they will start believing it and building trust in the population and community[.]""


Per the WHO's Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions framework, all treatment centers in the DRC are to be permitted to administer mAb114 and REGN-EB3 to patients, even though research into the two treatments is not yet complete, and ZMapp and remdesivir are to be retired.  A follow-on study, to be performed in the same four treatment centers as PALM, is to involve randomly assigning patients either a mAb114 or REGN-EB3 regimen.


In the DRC's current Ebola outbreak, two thirds of those known to be infected with Ebola, over 1800 people, have died.

John Hickenlooper, who was a candidate in the Democratic primaries for the 2020 United States presidential election, ended his campaign yesterday. Hickenlooper made his official announcement via a YouTube video in which he thanked his supporters.


According to reports, Hickenlooper was polling so low nationally, he was in danger of not qualifying for the next round of televised debates. Reports citing sources within the Democratic Party have indicated Hickenlooper was actively encouraged to drop out in favor of a run for a seat in the United States Senate.


Hickenlooper said in the video, ""I've heard from so many Coloradans who want me to run for the United States Senate. They remind me how much is at stake for our country. And our state. I intend to give that some serious thought.""


—John Hickenlooper

The senate seat from Colorado due for election next year is that of incumbent Republican Cory Gardner. Recent opinion polling by Democratic organizations indicated Hickenlooper is far more popular than any other Democrat running against Gardner and also ahead of Gardner.


Hickenlooper has served as mayor of Denver and governor of Colorado. His moderate politics have clashed with some of the stances of national leaders of his party such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren; he has notably come out against Medicare for all.


Besides his political career, Hickenlooper has been a successful entrepreneur, involved in the successful launch of a chain of pubs and restaurants.

Yesterday, what organizers estimated at 1.7 million Hongkongers, about a quarter of the city's population, marched from downtown Victoria Park toward the Central district, despite both pouring rain and police disapproval in the eleventh week of pro-Democracy protests against Chinese government encroachment on Hong Kong's rights and freedoms.


The Civil Human Rights Front had sent the police a plan for yesterday's march, which they rejected, approving only a gathering in Victoria Park.


Protesters started at the park, Causeway Bay, and Tin Hau early yesterday afternoon and walked until early evening, when police vans arrived, and the crowds dispersed. Many carried signs or wore eyepatches in reference to a young woman whose eye was said to have been severely injured by police in an earlier protest.


A university student named Wong said, ""Even though the weather was so bad, even in the face of threats of the People's Liberation Army and water cannons, Hong Kong people never back down. [...] For as long as the government doesn't respond, there will only be more large-scale protests.""


Hongkongers have been protesting since early June, when their government proposed a bill that would have allowed the central Chinese government to extradite people who had been accused of crimes from Hong Kong and try them in the mainland's judicial system.  Although the bill was suspended, protesters' demands have expanded to complete dismissal of the bill, an investigation of police misconduct during the protests, and greater democratic reform, including a more representative process of electing Hong Kong's leaders.


The British relinquished control of Hong Kong to China in 1997. Since then, the territory has been governed under the ""one country, two systems"" model, meaning the Chinese government has allowed Hong Kong to have its own legislature, justice system, and capitalist economic system.

Leon van Biljon, owner of Mahala View Lion Lodge near Pretoria, South Africa, was killed by his lions on Tuesday. Van Biljon, reportedly often referred to as ""The Lion Man"", had been in the lions' area attempting to mend a fence at the time, according to local news media.


Mahala View Lion Lodge formerly billed itself as home to three lions: Rambo, Katryn and Nakita. It is one of over two hundred lion lodges in South Africa, which collectively house and breed more than six thousand lions, scientists report, a population larger than that of wild lions in South Africa.


Connie Moganedi, a spokeswoman for the police department of nearby Cullinan, told CNN, neighbors from other lodges nearby attempted, but were unable, to save van Biljon. In the wake of van Biljon's death, Connie Moganedi said, the lions were killed. Van Biljon was seventy years old.

Andrea Zamperoni, the head chef of New York City's Cipriani Dolci restaurant, was discovered dead on Wednesday in Queens, New York, according to police on Thursday. Fernando Dallorso, the general manager of Cipriani Dolci, said his roommates said they last saw him on the preceding Saturday, August 17, after his shift at Cipriani Dolci in Manhattan. When he didn't come to work on Monday, his coworkers alerted the authorities.


Zamperoni was discovered, unresponsive, at Kamway Lodge & Tavern, a hostel near LaGuardia Airport. Police were answering a call regarding an unconscious man when they reached the scene at around 8:30 p.m. (0030 UTC). Zamperoni was pronounced dead at the scene.


As of Thursday, police were investigating the conditions leading up to his death, with no cause of death confirmed yet by the medical examiner. According to Dallorso, for days Zamperoni's phone was off and Zamperoni had not used his bank cards.


Zamperoni, 33, worked for somewhat over a year at Cipriani Dolci in Grand Central Terminal, but worked for Cipriani S.A., which owns the restaurant, for more than ten years, including abroad at Cipriani's London restaurant. His brother is a chef at the London location now.

On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron called for G7 action to correct what he named the international crisis of wildfires currently destroying Amazon rainforest in and around Brazil. G7 was already scheduled to meet this weekend. The call was quickly seconded by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.


""Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rainforest — the lungs which produces 20 percent of our planet's oxygen — is on fire. It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 Summit, let's discuss this emergency first order in two days!"" Macron told the world on Thursday via Twitter.


Merkel seconded Macron's recommendation the fires be added to the agenda.


""We stand ready"" tweeted Johnson ""to provide whatever help we can to bring them under control and help protect one of Earth's greatest wonders.""


Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro opposed Macron's statement: ""The French president's suggestion that Amazon issues be discussed at the G-7 without participation by the countries in the region evokes a colonialist mentality that is out of place in the 21st century[.]""


G7, or the Group of Seven, is an informal group of seven countries, the United Kingdom, United States, France, Canada, Germany, Japan, and Italy, though the European Union is also often involved. It grew out of the Group of Six, which started in the 1970s as a place for noncommunist countries to talk. Unlike G20, which focuses on economics, G7 meetings usually center on politics.


Brazil is not a member of G7, but it is part of a pact between the European Union and the South American group Mercosur, which requires Brazilian compliance with the Paris Climate Accord.


Brazil's National Institute for Space Research has reported there have been 85% more wildfires in Brazil in 2019 than there were in 2018. Bolsonaro has said publicly the Amazon rainforest should be opened up to agriculture, amongst other economic uses, and his critics, which include non-governmental environmental activism group Greenpeace, blame him for encouraging farmers and agrobusiness to set fires.


Around 3:00 p.m. local time on Monday (1800 UTC), smoke in the atmosphere turned the city of São Paulo, Brazil dark enough to require artificial lighting in a combination of cold front, clouds, and smoke from wildfires burning the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. The phenomenon lasted about an hour.


Experts attribute this to human activity. Amazon Environmental Research Institute Director Ane Alencar, in remarks to UOL.com.br, said, ""This year we do not have an extreme drought, as there was in 2015 and 2016 [...] In 2017 and 2018 we had a sufficient rainy season. In 2019, we have no weather events that affect droughts, such as El Niño [...] There's no way the weather can explain this increase.""


Around one million indigenous people live in the Amazon rainforest.

Yesterday, the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II announced she will comply with the request of Prime Minister Boris Johnson to suspend Parliament for parts of September and October. Critics from across Britain's political spectrum have claimed this is a move by Johnson to foil opposition to his plans for a no-deal Brexit by October 31.


Per the request, Parliament would meet briefly in early September and then not reconvene until October 14, two weeks before the current Brexit deadline. According to Johnson, this break will allow him to develop plans for his administration, which he is to present on October 14, the same day the Queen is scheduled to give a speech.


According to Johnson's critics, this is a ploy to achieve a no-deal Brexit, meaning the UK would cease to be part of the European Union (EU) without any specific arrangements made about trade, tariffs, the European Court of Justice, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, trademarks, and other matters. Currently, the British parliament has a majority against a no-deal Brexit.


""We're not going to wait until Oct. 31 before getting on with our plans to take this country forward"", Johnson said in an interview. ""This is a new government with a very exciting agenda"".


Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called the move a ""smash and grab on our democracy"".


House of Commons Speaker John Bercow commented on the matter — which the BBC noted as an unusual move by a Speaker — ""However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of [suspending Parliament] now would be to stop [Parliament] debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country.""


Prime Minister Johnson told the public via Twitter, ""Jeremy Corbyn wants to cancel the referendum and argue about Brexit for years [...] I am committed to leading our country forward and getting Britain out of the EU by October 31st.""


Member of Parliament (MP) Yvette Cooper of the Labour Party added, ""Boris Johnson is trying to use the Queen to concentrate power in his own hands — this is a deeply dangerous and irresponsible way to govern.""


Conservative MP Philip Hammond commented, ""It would be a constitutional outrage if Parliament were prevented from holding the government to account at a time of national crisis.""


In the government of the United Kingdom, the monarch is the head of state but not the head of government. Officially, the monarch is allowed to prorogue a session of Parliament, in which it is suspended but not officially dissolved. During prorogation, the members of parliament may not officially debate or work on laws or policies. According to the House of Commons Library, in the past few decades most prorogations have been for at most two weeks.

In an advisory issued at 11:00 a.m. local time today (1500 UTC) the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean had strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane. Dorian reached the Bahamas earlier today, making landfall in Elbow Cay. It was accompanied by a ""life-threatening"" 18 to 23 foot (5.5 to 7 meter) storm surge.


The NHC also warned of potential flash floods, with up to 30 inches (76 cm) of rain in northwestern parts of the Bahamas. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis urged residents to evacuate.


After passing over the Bahamas, Dorian was forecast to reach the eastern coast of the United States late on Monday or early Tuesday. The NHC issued a hurricane warning in the northwestern Bahamas and hurricane watch for Andros Island.


Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in anticipation of Dorian, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit yesterday. Palm Beach County in Florida issued an evacuation order to some residents, effective 1 p.m. on Sunday, after the NHC placed Palm Beach County under a tropical storm warning.


A Category 5 hurricane is a form of tropical cyclone. On the Saffir–Simpson scale used by the NHC for classifying tropical cyclones, at Category 5, ""catastrophic damage will occur"". The wind speed cut-off for Category 5 hurricanes is 157 miles per hour (mph); the NHC advisory indicated Dorian's maximum sustained winds were near 180 mph (285 kph).

In late August, the Canadian city of Toronto celebrated the quarter century anniversary of Fan Expo Canada, a massive annual pop culture convention. Running from August 22 to 25, the event featured extensive retail areas, panels, celebrity appearances, an artist alley, and attendees in cosplay. Wikinews attended.


At the panel ""Breaking Into Comics,"" speakers shared their insights into getting started as a comic artist or writer. Comic artist Jenn St-Onge (Nancy Drew, Jem and the Misfits) told of being forced to re-evaluate her life, after growing up with ample positive reinforcement about being an artist. ""In my first stint, I didn't get any work. [...] to come back and get that kind of second chance, eight years ago, it feels really good to have people coming to you and being 'I want you to work,' and basically working seven days a week for the last eight years.""


""You have to work those seven days to earn a weekend,"" quipped Valiant Entertainment editor Heather Antos, later in the panel. While all agreed that time off was rare as a freelancer, artist Leisha Riddell emphasized the need for boundaries, saying ""this weekend, I'm becoming part of the couch and playing video games until my eyes go blurry.""


Actress Denise Crosby is set to appear in the final season of Suits, a Toronto-shot legal series. The actress recalled her season with Star Trek: The Next Generation, when they were the ""scrappy little red headed stepchild of the [Paramount] lot.""


Underwhelmed with her role, she left the series toward the end of its first season. ""This is not what I wanted to become an actor for. I didn't want to stand on the bridge and just go 'aye aye captain,' you know, and not even move. I actually asked them to make up some fake legs"" to place at the character Tasha Yar's bridge station, which was on a risen platform. ""You could just stick my legs, just fake legs, and I had no lines[....] You gotta know that Tasha's on her command post, but just put the legs there, just keep the camera low.""


Actor Brendan Fraser's appearance at the convention was directly from filming The Professionals in South Africa. He quipped ""I still have dust in my shoes.""


The cast of the sitcom Kim's Convenience had a panel in a room for 700 people. The popular series is based on a 2011 stage play about a Korean-Canadian family that operates a convenience store. Simu Liu, one of the series leads, is to play the titular character in Marvel film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021).


Lead Paul Sun-Hyung Lee talked about how the series has been underestimated ""up 'til now."" During the premiere, ""I felt like Cinderella at the ball [...] I'm a jobber, I've been working as an actor for like, close to 25 years, lots of small roles. Expositionary characters, never asked to carry anything, to be a lead, to actually have a background story. And so to finally be able to do an entire season of television as one of the lead actors was tremendous"".


Hasbro hosted a panel about their Star Wars products, which promoted their new action figures and helmets. The company's upcoming replica helmet is of Luke Skywalker's X-wing helmet, their ""number one requested hero helmet [...] This by far is the most labor-intensive helmet to date."" While previous helmets have included movie sound, this product includes lights to simulate the enemy ships going past your head.


Asked about sustainability, the company noted that recently they had switched to a bio-based PET for their packaging, ""which was more plant-based plastic for greater environmental concerns. [...] This week, Hasbro announced that we're [...] looking to switch away from plastic altogether, in terms of our packaging [...] we're very much aware that a lot of times times plastic is [...] ripped off and discarded, so we're constantly trying to improve on that as a company to improve our environmental footprint.""


The event played host to the Rocket League WGN North American Championship, with the winning team receiving C$10,000 and a trip to a professional circuit event.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Kennedy_assassin_Sirhan_Sirhan_stabbed_in_California_prison,2019-09-03,Kennedy assassin Sirhan Sirhan stabbed in California prison,"Tuesday, September 3, 2019 


It was reported on Saturday Sirhan Sirhan was stabbed in the neck while in prison. Sirhan, 75, is serving a life sentence for the 1968 assassination of United States senator and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy.


Sirhan was serving his time at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego County, California. He was reported to be in stable condition.


The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) did not identify Sirhan as the victim. Rather, government sources confirmed his identity to various news outlets anonymously.


The Department issued a statement that an inmate had been stabbed: ""There was an assault on an inmate on Friday, August 30 at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility at 2:21 p.m. [...] Officers responded quickly and found an inmate with stab wound injuries [...] He was transported to an outside hospital for medical care, and is currently in stable condition."" They also said they believed they had identified the attacker, who was being held in isolation pending investigation.


Sirhan, an ethnic Palestinian from Jordan, opposed Senator Kennedy's pro-Israel position. Sirhan later claimed to have no memory of the night Kennedy was shot or of his own confession to the crime. For many years, Sirhan was held protectively separate from most prisoners at Corcoran State Prison because of his fame. At his own request, Sirhan was eventually transferred to the general population at Donovan.


Robert F. Kennedy was the brother of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who had himself been assassinated in 1963. Robert was killed in June 1968, while seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Sirhan shot him in the head just after midnight, while he was walking through a hotel kitchen. Sirhan's initial death sentence was commuted to life in prison when, for a time, California outlawed the death penalty.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Dozens_dead_in_California_boat_fire,2019-09-04,Dozens dead in California boat fire,"Wednesday, September 4, 2019 

A deadly boat fire earlier this week near Santa Cruz Island off the coast of California, United States, resulted in the death of all 33 passengers. The boat, Conception, which caught fire overnight in open seas, carried 33 passengers and six crew members. Five people, who were all crew, were rescued while the rest are presumed dead. 


The Conception was a 75 ft (~23 m) long commercial boat on a three-day voyage for underwater diving with Monday being the Labor Day holiday. The fire started some time after 3 a.m. local time {1000 UTC) Monday. ""This is probably the worst-case scenario you can possibly have,"" said Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown. ""You have a vessel that's on the open sea, that is in the middle of the night. I mean, it's 3:30 in the morning."" As of late Tuesday, 20 bodies had been recovered, eleven women and nine men, according to Brown.


The United States Coast Guard (USCG) called off its search late on Tuesday. USCG Captain Monica Rochester told the press a nearly 24-hour search mission involving three helicopters covering 160 square miles (~415 km2) had discovered no further signs in the water. ""It is never an easy decision to suspend search efforts,"" she said. ""We know that this is a very difficult time for families and friends of the victims.""


Authorities have not named a cause for the fire, though it was intimated there were no signs of an explosion and the Conception was known to have the requisite fire suppression equipment. CNN, however, reported on a distress call from someone on the Conception, who may or may not have been the captain. The excerpts, which are only the dispatcher's words were reported by CNN as such:


 And there's 33 people on board the vessel that's on fire, they can't get off? [...] Roger, are they locked inside the boat? [...] Roger, can you get back on board and unlock the boat, unlock the door so they can get off? [...] Roger, you don't have any firefighting gear at all? No fire extinguishers or anything?"" [...] Was that all the crew that jumped off? [...] Roger, is the vessel fully engulfed right now [...] Roger, and there's no escape hatch for any of the people on board?


 – USCG dispatcher, CNN

Commenting on the radio communications, Captain Rochester said the situation had ""a lot of adrenaline, a lot of confusion. [...] [The dispatcher] was trying to ask for information."" However, she added, ""there are no locked doors in accommodation spaces"" where the passengers would have been.


The Conception was owned by Truth Aquatics and chartered by Worldwide Diving Adventures. Both companies have been in operation since the 1970s according to USA Today.

As the slow-moving tropical cyclone known as Hurricane Dorian finally cleared the Bahamas yesterday, the level of destruction left in its wake began to emerge. Dorian made its initial landfall as a Category 5 hurricane in the Abaco Islands on Sunday. Its wind speeds reached 185 mph (~295 km/h), tied for the strongest sustained winds at landfalling on record, according to the National Hurricane Center.


After landfall, the speed at which Dorian moved slowed down dramatically, resulting in a very long stay over the island of Grand Bahama. In a thirty hour period of Monday and Tuesday, Dorian only traversed thirty miles, according to CNN. The National Hurricane Center said all tropical storm warnings were lifted as of yesterday morning and Dorian had also been downgraded to a Category 2 storm.


According to the BBC, residents were doing most rescue work themselves using boats and personal watercraft. Prime minister Hubert Minnis said yesterday night that twenty people have been confirmed killed. ""We expect that this number will increase"", he noted.


""Parts of Abaco are decimated [...] There is severe flooding. There is severe flooding damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure"", Minnis said. ""The southern aspect of Abaco has suffered less devastation than the north. The Sandy Point area and progressing north has not suffered as much devastation that was seen in the Marsh Harbour vicinity. The international airport on Abaco is under water. The runway is currently flooded. In fact, the area around the airport now looks like a lake.""


A large number of homes and other buildings in the affected areas have been destroyed with some estimates by the Red Cross and government officials ranging from 45% to 60% destruction. The United Nations said some 60 thousand people are in need of food and drinking water.


Dorian was northbound as it left the Bahamas.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Hong_Kong_leader_announces_withdrawal_of_extradition_bill,2019-09-06,Hong Kong leader announces withdrawal of extradition bill,"Friday, September 6, 2019 

On Wednesday, Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, announced that her government will officially withdraw a proposed bill that would have allowed China to extradite accused criminals from Hong Kong to be tried under the mainland's criminal justice system. This was one of the five demands of the protesters, sometimes numbering in the millions, who have filled downtown streets since early this June.


""The government will fully withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,"" Lam said in a televised announcement. Lam also agreed to add two members to Hong Kong's existing police oversight council but did not accede to protesters' demands for a new judge-led investigation independent of the government.


""Our citizens, police and reporters have been injured during violent incidents,"" Lam continued in the statement. ""There have been chaotic scenes at the airport and [mass transit railway] stations; roads and tunnels have been suddenly blocked. Visitors wonder whether our city is still a safe place for travel or business. Families and friends have been under stress, and arguments have flared. For many people, Hong Kong has become an unfamiliar place.""


There has been skepticism among academics and the protesters themselves about the sincerity and effects of the bill's withdrawal:


""Whenever there are signs of sending a palm branch,"" wrote student protester Joshua Wong on Twitter. ""They always come with a far tighter grip on exercising civil rights[.] They have conceded nothing in fact, and a full-scale clampdown is on the way.""


""She's just doing this to try and disintegrate the movement. A lot of people think that,"" said a protester using the pseudonym Katya. ""The situation has escalated to a point where not even Beijing knows how to sort this. So they're using different tricks and lies. Hong Kong people have learned to ignore her.""


""This announcement cannot change the fact that the Hong Kong authorities have chosen to suppress protests in a grossly unlawful way that has seriously damaged the people's trust and sense of legitimacy of the government,"" Hong Kong director of Amnesty International Man-kei Tam said in a statement.


More than 1000 people have been arrested since the protests began in June, according to The Guardian.

Adam Kokesh, an Iraq War veteran, activist, radio show host, and currently a candidate for the US Libertarian Party's 2020 presidential nomination, spoke with Wikinews to discuss his background, political positions, and campaign for President of the United States.


Kokesh, who hails from Arizona, has been active in the anti-war movement since returning home from combat in Iraq.  After an initial honorary discharge from active duty with the US Marine Corp in 2006, Kokesh was given a general discharge from the Marine Forces Reserve in 2007 after images of him wearing his uniform while participating in a protest with the Iraq Veterans Against the War were published in The Washington Post.  Kokesh has also been involved in demonstrations in support of free speech, gun rights, and marijuana decriminalization.  Some of these activities have resulted in his arrest.  Kokesh previously hosted a show on RT and currently hosts a show on internet radio.


Politically, Kokesh supported the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns of Ron Paul.  He was a featured speaker at Paul's Rally for the Republic in 2008.  Kokesh ran for US Congress as a Republican in 2010 in New Mexico and for US Senate in Arizona in 2018.  He announced his 2020 candidacy in 2013 during a jailhouse interview.  He has based his campaign on the pledge to begin ""dissolving the federal government in a peaceful, orderly manner"" and to resign as president and take the title of ""Custodian of the Federal Government.""  


Other contenders for the Libertarian Party's 2020 presidential nomination include former Libertarian Party Vice Chairman Arvin Vohra, businessman John McAfee, and New Hampshire state representative Max Abramson.  Congressman Justin Amash and former Rhode Island governor and US Senator Lincoln Chafee are both reportedly considering runs.  Former New York gubernatorial candidate Larry Sharpe and former Massachusetts governor William Weld were both previously considered potential candidates but Sharpe suggested he would not run and Weld has decided to run in the 2020 Republican Party presidential primaries, challenging President Donald Trump.


With accredited Wikinews reporter William S. Saturn, Kokesh details his background and activism, his thoughts on the Libertarian Party, the Presidency of Donald Trump, and the goals for his campaign and presidency.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Scientists_report_skyrocketing_phytoplankton_population_in_aftermath_of_K%C4%ABlauea_eruption,2019-09-08,Scientists report skyrocketing phytoplankton population in aftermath of Kīlauea eruption,"Sunday, September 8, 2019 


On Thursday, the journal Science published a report by a team from the University of Hawaii at Mānoa (UH Mānoa) and the University of Southern California (USC), saying the eruption of the Kīlauea volcano last year has been followed by a dramatic increase in the population of phytoplankton, also called green algae, in the waters surrounding the island.


Study co-author and geochemist Seth John remarked in a press release, ""There was no reason for us to expect that an algae bloom like this would happen [...] Lava doesn't contain any nitrate."" 


According to the hypothesis of the report, the microbe population grew because there was suddenly a large quantity of nitrates in the water for them to feed on.  Although the lava itself was low in nitrates, it heated the deeper layers of nutrient-rich water.  This upward current brought the nitrates nearer to the surface, where phytoplankton, which also need sunlight, tend to live.


UH Mānoa dispatched the research ship Ka'imikai-O-Kanaloa from July 13 to 17 of last year, when Kīlauea was still erupting, and it sailed very close to where the lava entered the ocean so researchers could study the organisms and water chemistry there.


Co-lead author Sam Wilson of UH Mānoa's Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE) said, ""The expedition in July 2018 provided a unique opportunity to see first-hand how a massive input of external nutrients alters marine ecosystems that are finely attuned to low-nutrient conditions [...] Ecosystem responses to such a substantial addition of nutrients are rarely observed or sampled in real time. UH has a strong tradition of not only volcanic research, but also looking at its impacts on the surrounding environment such as the ocean, groundwater, atmosphere. This latest piece of research improves our understanding of lava-seawater interactions within the much broader context of land-ocean connections.""


The mass of microbe-rich water, called a plume, was large enough to detect from space.  The research team used both satellite images and subsurface gliders to study the water.


The study's lead authors, Wilson of C-MORE and Nick Hawco of USC, had initially hypothesized the lava itself would cause an increase in microbes that rely on iron and phosphates by directly supplying them with those nutrients.  They found there was so much iron and phosphate that the particles coalesced into clumps where these microbes could not get to them.  Other microbes, dependent on nitrates, came to dominate the plume instead.


Unlike red algae, whose blooms can damage the ecosystem, green algae form the basis of the food chain, providing food for crustaceans and larger organisms.  A similar volcanic eruption in Alaska in 2008 was found to be associated with an increase in the local salmon population. Green algae also absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.


The researchers have speculated this upwelling pattern may have occurred repeatedly during the volcanic process that produced the Hawaiian Island chain.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Longtime_leader_of_Zimbabwe_Robert_Mugabe_dies_aged_95,2019-09-09,Longtime leader of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe dies aged 95,"Monday, September 9, 2019 

Robert Mugabe, former president of Zimbabwe, has died, according to current president Emmerson Mnangagwa on Friday. He was 95. Mugabe was hospitalized in Singapore for several months this year and according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs he died at Gleneagles Hospital in the morning. Mugabe was considered the founding father of Zimbabwe.


Robert Gabriel Mugabe was born in 1924 in Kutama, Zimbabwe, when the country was a British colony called Southern Rhodesia. Mugabe's first career was as a teacher. He taught and studied in various sub-Saharan countries in Africa.  He embraced Marxism.  He later returned to Rhodesia, which within a few years thereafter declared independence from the United Kingdom, but still under white rule.


Mugabe co-founded the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) to oppose the white minority rule, but was arrested in 1963 and was imprisoned until 1974. After his release, Mugabe led a militant guerrilla movement against Ian Smith's government; successful, Mugabe was hailed a national hero. He was also praised in the West.


Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe, serving as its first prime minister, 1980–1987; then as president, 1987–2017; for 37 years. He supported education, healthcare, and peasant farming, and a few years into his tenure, Zimbabwe had a strong economy and rising literacy rates and, according to CNN, was called the ""breadbasket"" of southern Africa But during these early years, Mugabe also became known for his violent treatment of opponents; the Gukurahundi massacres saw thousands if not tens of thousands of ethnic Ndebele killed.


When Mugabe assumed the presidency in 1987, he also became head of the armed forces and had successfully consolidated consolidated power over Zimbabwe. In the 1990s, he instituted a policy of confiscating land from white farm-owners and redistributing it. Some of those seizing the land were ostensibly veterans of the war and they would sometimes kill the farmers and the black laborers who worked there. Agricultural production decreased sharply and inflation inversely rocketed.


In 2000, a new threat to Mugabe's rule emerged in the form of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Mugabe won a presidential election over Morgan Tsvangirai of the MDC, but amid reports of violence and fraud, neither the European Union nor the United States would endorse the result. At the next elections in 2008, the MDC won a majority in the House of Assembly and both Mugabe and Tsvangirai claimed victory in the presidential vote, which again was marred by allegations of fraud and tampering. Refusing to give up power, Mugabe agreed to power-sharing in which Tsvangirai became prime minister. ""Only God who appointed me will remove me — not the MDC, not the British,"" he declared.


The following election in 2013 saw a substantial victory for Mugabe, and despite Tsvangirai's allegations of widespread fraud, Mugabe ended the power-sharing. Soon after, however, rumors circulated he was preparing his wife — four decades his junior — to become his successor. Grace Mugabe was already unpopular for her penchant of flaunting an extravagant lifestyle in a country which was becoming increasingly poor.


After Mugabe fired his vice president, ahead of the 2018 elections, the army moved on November 15, 2017, having first placed Mugabe under house arrest. Nevertheless, Mugabe was able to negotiate immunity from prosecution, full diplomatic status and a fully staffed state-funded 25-room home, known as the ""Blue House"", in exchange for his official resignation on November 21.


""It is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe's founding father and former President, Cde [comrade] Robert Mugabe. [...] Cde Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace"", wrote President Mnangagwa.


Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, said in a statement: ""Many important dates in Zimbabwe’s modern history are tied to the name of Robert Mugabe. He made a great personal contribution to the battle for your country’s independence, to the building of Zimbabwean State institutions.""


""For my generation, Mr Robert Mugabe should be remembered for what he was to us. He was a dictator. He was ruthless. He is the author of the current economic and political challenges we're facing as a nation"", said Ashton Bumhira, director of Youth Forum Zimbabwe.

On Saturday night, a propeller plane in Nevada, United States crashed following departure from Henderson Executive Airport, near Las Vegas, according to investigators. At the time, there were reportedly four people on board; according to investigators, one was pronounced dead at the crash site, with the other three being taken to a nearby hospital. Another later died. A bystander was also subsequently injured.


Officials said the single-engine propeller plane, a Beechcraft Sierra, was flying to Gillespie Field airport, located near San Diego in El Cajon, California. Following take off, the plane turned back with a mechanical problem, intending to land at Henderson. It crashed in a desert area located about half a mile (likely less than a kilometer) to the south of the airport, and then caught fire. A bystander attempted to aid the passengers, and was later hospitalized for smoke inhalation.


The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began investigations of the crash of the place, which was built in 1977. Keith Holloway, an NTSB spokesman, told Fox News their investigation could last as long as two years but a preliminary report would likely be available in the next few weeks.

Per request of United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Queen suspended parliament for five weeks yesterday. The move, called prorogation, came after a second motion for snap elections failed to pass. The United Kingdom is in the process of leaving the European Union which has been termed Brexit for ""British exit"".


Monday's bid for October elections failed to get the two-thirds majority required. According to the BBC, it is commonplace for new governments — Johnson became prime minister in July — to suspend parliament, but apparently using it as a tool in his Brexit strategy has been controversial. Parliament is to remain out-of-session through October 14; the Brexit deadline is October 31.


The United Kingdom voted on June 23, 2016, to leave the European Union in the Brexit referendum. The original deadline to leave was extended previously to its current date, but it is Johnson's stated intent for the UK to leave with or without a trade deal with the EU and not seek any further extensions. 


""[W]e must get Brexit done, because the UK must come out [...] by October 31st, or else I fear that permanent damage will be done in the UK to trust our democratic system"", Johnson said in a video statement released in conjunction with a visit to Ireland with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.


During these five weeks of prorogation, parliament cannot pass legislation, as no votes, debates or Prime Minister's Questions can take place. Members of the House of Commons protested by shouting ""shame on you!"" and holding signs which read ""silenced"" during Monday's final session.


Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said his Labour Party ""[are] eager for an election — but as keen as we are, we are not prepared to risk inflicting the disaster of no deal on our communities, our jobs, our services, or indeed our rights"".


Johnson asked Queen Elizabeth II for this prorogation in August. Johnson became leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister after Theresa May stepped down on July 24 after she was unable to negotiate a Brexit deal.

Akilisi Pohiva, the prime minister of Tonga, died today at 10:00 a.m. Tongan time (2100 UTC, yesterday) at the age of 78. Pohiva, who had been Tonga's prime minister since his election in 2014, was evacuated Wednesday afternoon from Tonga's capital, Nukuʻalofa, to a hospital in Auckland, New Zealand, with pneumonia.


ABC reported that Pohiva received medical treatment in New Zealand for problems with his liver this year. In the wake of Pohiva's death, Tonga's parliament, the Legislative Assembly, was suspended indefinitely according to local media.


Pohiva was a long-time advocate for democratization in Tonga, The Guardian reported. When elected prime minister by the parliament in 2014, it was the first time they had elected a commoner to the office; historically, prime ministers were appointed by the King or Queen. He first joined parliament in 1987, making him the longest serving member of Tonga's parliament. During that service, he was once jailed for contempt of parliament, in 1996, and was also changed with sedition in the aftermath of the 2006 pro-democracy riots in Nukuʻalofa.


Prior to joining parliament, Pohiva taught classes in sociology and history at the University of the South Pacific's campus in Tonga. In 2013, he became the first Pacific Islander to be awarded the Parliamentarians for Global Action's Defender of Democracy Award.

On Tuesday, United States President Donald Trump announced he had asked for national security advisor John R. Bolton's resignation Monday night, and that Bolton tendered it the next morning.


Bolton had held the position since April 2018 and was the third official to serve in that office during the Trump administration since 2017.


""I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration,"" wrote Trump on Twitter, ""and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.""


Bolton gave a different account of events, also speaking via Twitter: ""I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow.' ""


Reportedly, Trump and Bolton have been at odds over the president's handling of issues with North Korea, Iran and the Afghan Taliban. Bolton was also much more of a critic of Russia than was Trump. Reportedly also, Bolton often had disagreements with Mike Pompeo who is the secretary of state.


""I don't think that any leader around the world should make any assumption that because some one of us departs that President Trump’s foreign policy will change in a material way"", Pompeo told the press on Tuesday. ""There were many times that Ambassador Bolton and I disagreed. That's to be sure.""


Bolton previously served as the US ambassador to the United Nations under former president George W. Bush.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Scottish_court_finds_suspension_of_UK_parliament_unlawful,2019-09-13,Scottish court finds suspension of UK parliament unlawful,"Friday, September 13, 2019 

On Wednesday, the Court of Session in Scotland issued an opinion on the suspension — prorogation — of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which went into effect on Tuesday, finding it to be unlawful. The Court of Session is the highest civil court in Scotland. The only court with higher authority is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.


The court had been petitioned by Joanna Cherry of the Scottish National Party and 78 co-petitioners for a ruling on the prorogation of the UK parliament by Queen Elizabeth II at the request of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Cherry and all but one of the petitioners are members of UK parliament.


The three-judge court found Johnson's advice to the Queen ""was motivated by the improper purpose of stymying Parliament and that it, and what has followed from it, is unlawful.""  Colin Sutherland, Lord Carloway, the Lord President of the court decided, according to the summary, ""that although advice to HM [Her Majesty] the Queen on the exercise of the royal prerogative of prorogating Parliament was not reviewable on the normal grounds of judicial review, it would nevertheless be unlawful if its purpose was to stymie parliamentary scrutiny of the executive"".


The court's summary concluded with the statement: ""The Court will accordingly make an Order declaring that the Prime Minister’s advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect.""


First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon said via Twitter, ""Today's Court of Session judgment is of huge constitutional significance — but the immediate political implications are clear. Court says prorogation was unlawful and null and void — so Parliament must be recalled immediately to allow the essential work of scrutiny to continue.""


Cherry, who led the petition, said, ""Now, for every moment Parliament remains prorogued, the British government are breaking the law.""


According to the BBC, a spokeman for 10 Downing Street expressed disappointment and that the prime minister's office intends to appeal; ""The UK government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda. Proroguing Parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Astronomers_find_water_vapour_in_atmosphere_of_exoplanet_K2-18b,2019-09-14,Astronomers find water vapour in atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b,"Saturday, September 14, 2019 


In findings published Tuesday in Cornell University's arXiv by a team of scientists from the University of Montreal and a separate report published Wednesday in Nature Astronomy by a team from University College London (UCL), the presence of water vapour was confirmed in the atmosphere of K2-18b, a planet circling a star in the constellation Leo.  This is the first such discovery in a planet in its star's habitable zone — not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist.


The Montreal team, led by Björn Benneke, used data from the NASA's Hubble telescope to assess changes in the light coming from K2-18b's star as the planet passed between it and Earth.  They found that certain wavelengths of light, which are usually absorbed by water, weakened when the planet was in the way, indicating not only does K2-18b have an atmosphere, but the atmosphere contains water in vapour form.  The team from UCL then analyzed the Montreal team's data using their own software and confirmed their conclusion.


This was not the first time scientists have found signs of water on an exoplanet, but previous discoveries were made on planets with high temperatures or other pronounced differences from Earth.


""This is the first potentially habitable planet where the temperature is right and where we now know there is water,"" said UCL astronomer Angelos Tsiaras. ""It's the best candidate for habitability right now.""


""It's a good sign"", said Ryan Cloutier of the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was not one of either study's authors. ""Overall,"" he continued, ""the presence of water in its atmosphere certainly improves the prospect of K2-18b being a potentially habitable planet, but further observations will be required to say for sure.""


K2-18b was first identified in 2015 by the Kepler space telescope.  It is about 110 light-years from Earth and larger but less dense.  Its star, a red dwarf, is cooler than the Sun, but the planet's orbit is much closer, such that a year on K2-18b lasts 33 Earth days.


According to The Guardian, astronomers were optimistic that NASA's James Webb space telescope — scheduled for launch in 2021 — and the European Space Agency's 2028 ARIEL program, could reveal more about exoplanets like K2-18b.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Oil_facilities_in_Saudi_Arabia_hit_by_drone_attacks,2019-09-15,Oil facilities in Saudi Arabia hit by drone attacks,"Sunday, September 15, 2019 





Yesterday, oil facilities belonging to Saudi Arabia's state-owned Saudi Aramco were hit by multiple drone strikes in a pre-dawn raid. The attacks triggered major fires at a processing plant and an oil field, which state media said were under control. The Yemen-based Houthi movement claimed responsibility for the attacks.


According to the Saudi Press Agency, the attacks occurred at 4:00 A.M. local time (0100 UTC) and struck the largest processing plant at Abqaiq and the Khurais oil field. The oil field is about 160 km (100 miles) east of the capital, Riyadh. The agency did not mention if there were casualties, but said exports were continuing.


Reuters, citing anonymous sources, reported both production and export of oil had been disrupted. Saudi officials subsequently said 5.7  million barrels of per-day production had been disrupted. This would be nearly half of Saudi Arabia's entire production and around five percent on a global basis.


Speaking on al-Masirah TV in Yemen, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said it had carried out the attack using ten drones. According to him, it was among the largest Houthi operations inside of Saudi Arabia and was accomplished with the help of ""honourable people inside the kingdom"".


""These attacks are our right, and we warn the Saudis that our targets will keep expanding"", Saree said. ""We have the right to strike back in retaliation to the air strikes and the targeting of our civilians for the last five years.""


US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo posted a message on Twitter blaming Iran for the attacks, saying there was ""no evidence the attacks came from Yemen."" BBC's Jonathan Marcus said questions remain how much direct Iranian assistance is received by the Houthis who are ideologically aligned with Iran.


In 2015, Saudi Arabia started supporting the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi against the Houthi rebellion, providing airstrikes with the Royal Saudi Air Force. The United Nations called the resulting humanitarian crisis the worst in the world.


In 2006, Abqaiq was the target of an Al-Qaeda suicide attack.

In an advisory issued late Sunday night, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded Tropical Storm Humberto to hurricane status, making it the third hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. Humberto, now officially Hurricane Humberto, is a category 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday night had no associated hurricane watches or warning.


The NHC's Hurricane Humberto Advisory Number 14, released at 11:00 p.m. EDT on Sunday (0300 UTC Monday morning) placed Humberto 785 miles (1260 kilometers) west of Bermuda. According to data collected by one of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ""Hurricane Hunters"", Humberto had maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour (120 kilometers per hour) and was moving northeast at 3 mph (6 kph).


On Saturday, Humberto hovered to the east of Great Abaco Island for a few hours, but once it moved on the Bahamian government withdrew its tropical storm warnings. According to the Miami Herald, Humberto is not expected to make landfall in the United States or in the Bahamas. The NHC, as of Sunday night, had no outstanding hurricane warnings.


Tropical Storm Humberto was the eighth named storm of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, and became its third hurricane. Forming in July 2019, Hurricane Barry was the first hurricane of the season, and it was followed by Hurricane Dorian in late August.


Tropical storms and hurricanes are both forms of tropical cyclones. On the Saffir–Simpson scale, which is used by the NHC for classifying tropical cyclones, category 1 hurricanes must sustain winds of at least 74 miles per hour. The cut-off for a category 2 hurricane, the next stronger classification, is 119 mph.

On Saturday, in a brief but official statement, US President Donald Trump said Hamza bin Laden, son of the late Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, has been killed in a US counter-terrorism operation. The statement specified no date or exact location. The alleged death of Hamza was previously in the news at the end of July based on unconfirmed reports.


Trump's statement read: ""Hamza bin Ladin, the high-ranking al-Qa’ida member and son of Usama bin Ladin, was killed in a United States counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region.  The loss of Hamza bin Ladin not only deprives al-Qa’ida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father, but undermines important operational activities of the group.  Hamza bin Ladin was responsible for planning and dealing with various terrorist groups.""


On July 31, multiple news outlets reported Hamza bin Laden to be dead citing sources within the United States Department of Defense. Per reports, the sources said he died within two years before, perhaps within a few months, but the US had only recently come to believe he was dead. The press asked Trump about it that same day, but he declined to comment.


Retired FBI agent and terrorism specialist Ali Soufan told NPR Hamza bin Laden had appeared in Al-Qaeda videos since he was a young boy and his father saw a leadership role for him. Hamza bridged a generational gap between newer Al-Qaeda members and veteran members, according to Soufan.


The US State Department described Hamza bin Laden in March of this year as an ""emerging"" figure in the Al-Qaeda organization when they offered a one million US dollar reward for information leading to his capture.


Osama bin Laden founded Al-Qaeda and orchestrated the 9/11 attacks on the US of 2001. Osama was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011.

Yesterday, Thames Valley Police said they had arrested a second man in connection with the theft of a gold toilet. The toilet, an artwork, was stolen on Saturday from Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, England. Another man, who was was arrested on the day of the theft, was released on bail. The toilet has not been recovered.


Police arrested a 36-year-old Cheltenham man on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle. They subsequently released him pending investigation. On Saturday they arrested a 66-year-old man on suspicion of burglary, and released him on bail till October. ""We are continuing to investigate this incident and have made a second arrest in connection with it. Our priority is to locate the stolen item, and I would urge anyone with any information to contact police by calling 101"", said Detective Inspector Steven Jones.


The toilet is an artwork entitled America made by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. It is a fully functioning toilet made from 18-karat gold. Dominic Hare, chief executive of the palace, placed the value of the artwork in the range of five to six million US dollars. It had been fully plumbed and installed for visitors to use at Blenheim. When it was removed by the burglars it caused flooding and water damage to the building. Police said on Monday they believe the theft involved a group of thieves and multiple vehicles.


""At first, when they woke me up this morning with the news, I thought it was a prank: Who's so stupid to steal a toilet?"" wrote Cattelan, the artist, in an e-mail to The New York Times. ""I had forgotten for a second that it was made out of gold.""


Back in 2017, the artwork was offered to Donald Trump, the president of the United States. Dominic Hare said the toilet represented a ""comment on the American dream"".

In an advisory issued yesterday evening, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) confirmed that a hurricane warning for Hurricane Humberto, a category 3 hurricane, was in effect for Bermuda. Humberto was expected to pass by Bermuda late Wednesday night.


The NHC's ""Hurricane Humberto Intermediate Advisory Number 25A"", released at 8:00 p.m. AST on Wednesday (0000 UTC Thursday morning) placed Humberto 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of Bermuda. At the time, Humberto had maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) and was moving east-by-northeast at 20 mph (31 kph).


The NHC predicted that Humberto would pass by Bermuda Wednesday night, before beginning to weaken on Thursday. The advisory also noted dangerous surf conditions, with waves over 30 feet high being recorded offshore by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) buoy, warning of a possibility of coastal flooding.


Bermuda was rarely hit by hurricanes according to CNN who reported that over the last century, only 21 hurricanes reached within 100 miles of the islands. The most recent hurricane to reach Bermuda, Hurricane Gonzalo, made landfall there in 2014.


Hurricanes are a form of tropical cyclones. On the Saffir–Simpson scale used by the NHC for classifying tropical cyclones, a category 3 hurricane must sustain winds of at least 111 miles per hour. The cut-off for a category 4 hurricane, the next stronger classification, is 130 mph. Hurricanes classified as category 3 or above are considered to be ""major"" hurricanes.

Very early Wednesday morning, an engineer was killed while working at Waterloo station in the British capital London. Emergency services received the call at about 2:20 a.m. local time (0120 UTC), according to British Transport Police (BTP), but the man was found dead at the scene. He was working on a travelator — a moving walkway — at the station when the incident occurred.


Waterloo station is in central London and is part of the London Underground mass transit system. London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade were the first responders and already there when BTP arrived, by BTP's report. The man was a 44-year-old contract worker from Cambridgeshire, England.


The travelator allows passengers to transfer between the Northern and Jubilee lines of the Underground. Transport for London (TfL) told morning rush-hour passengers to take a longer way around instead of the travelator.


BTP started an investigation of the death, which they treated as not suspicious but unexplained. Detective Inspector Darren Gough said, ""This is a truly tragic incident, and our deepest condolences are with the man’s family."" An official from TfL stated: ""We are working with colleagues in the British Transport Police following an incident at Waterloo station in the early hours of this morning.""


The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, gave his condolences via Twitter, adding, ""An urgent enquiry into what happened is underway to ensure it cannot happen again.""

Yesterday, Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, New York, ended his campaign for president of the United States. De Blasio made the announcement live on television just after 7:30 a.m. EDT (1130 UTC). Various opinion polls showed national support for de Blasio at no more than one percent of voters.


Mayor de Blasio, a member of the Democratic Party, spoke on MSNBC's morning news talk show Morning Joe when he made the announcement: ""I feel like I have contributed all I can to this primary election, and it’s clearly not my time, so I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.""


De Blasio joined the presidential race in May. His progressive campaign platform failed to resonate with voters. Polling averages measured by RealClearPolitics showed support at less than one percent and a recent poll by Siena College rounded his number to zero percent, even in his native New York City. He did not qualify to participate in further Democratic debates after the first two.


Incumbent President Donald Trump quickly took a parting shot on Twitter: ""Oh no, really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in years! Part time Mayor of New York City, [Bill de Blasio], who was polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth, has shocking[ly] dropped out of the Presidential race.""


Fellow Democrats were more supportive in their comments: ""Thank you [Bill de Blasio] for making working families the center of your campaign. This is our moment to fight for an America that works for all of us — not just the people at the top. Let's keep fighting"", wrote Elizabeth Warren on Twitter. Bernie Sanders wrote, ""Congratulations to [Bill de Blasio] on running a campaign to lift up working people and push for bold solutions we need, including making health care a right through Medicare for All.""


Both Warren and Sanders remain — along with several others — in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Friday was when, according to earlier event plans, millions of people were to storm Area 51, a classified facility within the United States Air Force's Nevada Test and Training Range, and the world was to finally learn of its secrets. In the end, an estimated one-to-two hundred people showed up at the gates, and the classified area was not stormed.


It all began on June 27, when Matty Roberts posted a event invitation on social media site Facebook. More than two million people replied they would attend and an additional million-and-a-half expressed interest in the event. Roberts says his event, ""Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us"", was posted as a joke. Roberts is about 20 years old and from Bakersfield, California.


The event description read, ""We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry [...] If we Naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Let's see them aliens."" Area 51 has for decades been rumored to be a facility for UFO and extraterrestrials research. Naruto is a Japanese cartoon ninja character who runs with his arms behind his back.


As the event turned viral, both media and authorities took notice. The nearest settlement to Area 51 is Rachel in Lincoln County. It is a remote desert town with a population of around fifty people. The Little A'Le'Inn is the only business offering food and accommodations and the town has no gas stations. County sheriff Kerry Lee told the BBC even one percent of Facebook users attending ""would be more overwhelming than we can handle"". The Air Force issued warnings against attempts to enter the restricted zone of the base, saying it was dangerous.


The sheriff's office arranged for reinforcements from across Nevada. Fewer than two hundred showed up at the gates of the base, but no one tried to storm the military base. Sheriff Lee said they arrested one person for urinating in public, technically indecent exposure. They arrested three for ""suspicion of trespassing"" and another for an incident related to alcohol. Over a thousand were reported to have reached Rachel, but most did not make the final trek to the base.


Meanwhile, other events popped up seeking to capitalize on the notoriety of the Storm Area 51 event. In nearby Hiko, a ""Storm Area 51 Basecamp Experience"" was underway with music and other entertainment. Thursday night, ""Alien Stock"" was held in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada with involvement of original poster Matty Roberts.


Bob Lazar was reputedly responsible for creating much of the folklore surrounding Area 51 which is not an official name. A 2018 documentary film titled Bob Lazar: Area 51 & Flying Saucers may have spurred recent interest.

Yesterday, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said if the goal is peace and security, then foreign powers should ""get out of the region"" as their presence could cause an arms race. He also announced a new security initiative for the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz to be unveiled at the United Nations General Assembly later this week.


Rouhani was speaking at the opening of Sacred Defence Week, an annual commemoration of the eight-year Iran–Iraq War, which features military parades. ""The presence of foreign forces can be dangerous for the region, international waters, as well as the security of shipping lines and energy, but our path is to create unity and coordination with regional countries,"" he said. ""Those who want to link the region’s incidents to the Islamic Republic of Iran are lying like their past lies that have been revealed [...] If they are truthful and really seek security in the region, they must not send weapons, fighter jets, bombs and dangerous arms to the region.""


""Your presence has always been a calamity for this region and the farther you go from our region and our nations, the more security would come for our region"", he continued in the speech which was delivered in Tehran, the capital. Rouhani's new security plan would be led by Iran and feature support from regional countries in securing the waterways in the region. According to the Associated Press, Iran has increased cooperation in the last few years with the navies of China, India, Oman, Pakistan, and Russia.


The speech came approximately one week after an attack on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia which halved Saudi oil output. The attack was claimed by the Houthi movement in Yemen, but both Saudi Arabia and the United States have alleged Iranian involvement. The initial reports were of drone attacks, but the Saudi government said the attack included cruise missles which could not have originated in Yemen.


The United States was more forceful in blaming Iran for the attack, committing to send more troops to Saudi Arabia. Recently, the United States announced a naval coalition to patrol the Persian Gulf which was joined by Australia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates.


The annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly is set to open tomorrow.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/UK_Supreme_Court_rules_prorogation_of_parliament_unlawful,2019-09-24,UK Supreme Court rules prorogation of parliament unlawful,"Tuesday, September 24, 2019 


Today at 10:30 BST (0930 UTC), the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom issued a ruling on the prorogation — a procedural suspension — of the Parliament of the United Kingdom until October 14. The court found that it could rule on the prorogation, and found the prorogation to be unlawful. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal on all civil matters in the United Kingdom, as well as criminal matters in parts of the United Kingdom. The Supreme Court is lead by President Brenda Hale.


The summary of the decision read in part: ""This Court has already concluded that the Prime Minister's advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the Order in Council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the Royal Commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.""


Queen Elizabeth II suspended parliament at the behest of Boris Johnson, the current prime minister, on September 10. He is widely suspected of asking for prorogation to prevent legislative interference in his efforts to complete the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU), known as Brexit for British exit. Following that reasoning, the Court of Session in Scotland ruled on September 11 the prorogation was unlawful. The Supreme Court ruled on the appeal of that decision by Johnson's government.


The High Court of England and Wales also ruled on the same day as the Scottish court, finding that the prorogation of Parliament was not a matter for the courts: ""In our view,  the decision  of  the  Prime  Minister to advise Her Majesty the Queen to prorogue Parliament is not justiciable in Her Majesty’s courts.""


For three days last week, the court heard arguments from the two sides. Former prime minister John Major has accused Johnson of misleading the Queen, and argued that the true intent of seeking prorogation was to shut down debate in parliament, as the Court of Session found. The government's counter-argument was that prorogation is a political tool given by the legislature to the executive branch. If Parliament does not like prorogation or how it is used, it has the power to change the law. It is not for the Court to opine about the motivations, argued the government's lawyer, Richard Keen.


Britons voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the EU. After failed negotiations for a deal on trade and deadline extension the deadline currently stands at October 31, 2019. Johnson has repeatedly stated that Britain must leave by that date with or without a deal. On September 13 — two days after the Court of Session ruling — he said he remained ""cautiously optimistic"" a deal would be reached.

On Monday, US singer and lyricist Robert Hunter died at his home in San Rafael, California. His family's announcement of his death specified no cause, but, according to his agent, Hunter had undergone surgery recently. The former lyricist of rock band Grateful Dead was 78.


Hunter composed lyrics for several songs by US psychedelic rock band the Grateful Dead, including many of their biggest hits. He also collaborated with Dead associates Mickey Hart and Bruce Hornsby and artists such as Elvis Costello, Bob Dylan, and Jim Lauderdale.


Born Robert Burns in Arroyo Grande, California on June 23, 1941, he took his stepfather's name sometime in his youth and met future Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia when both were in their late teens. The duo formed a brief musical partnership that was interrupted by Garcia joining a bluegrass band and Hunter having personal complications from participation in Project MKUltra, a CIA mind control program to test psychedelic drugs on US citizens.


After Hunter retreated to New Mexico and continued to write songs he would mail to Garcia in the San Francisco Bay Area, Garcia invited him to collaborate in Garcia's new group, the Grateful Dead. Hunter joined the group as a songwriter, providing lyrics to songs such as ""Dark Star"", ""Uncle John's Band"", and ""Truckin'"" throughout the late 1960s and into the 1970s.


He continued as a solo performer, releasing several albums and occasionally touring into the 2010s. He also wrote for other artists, including co-writing several songs on folk rock musician Bob Dylan's 2009 release Together Through Life.


Hunter is survived by wife Maureen.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/US_Speaker_Pelosi_announces_Trump_impeachment_investigation,2019-09-25,US Speaker Pelosi announces Trump impeachment investigation,"Wednesday, September 25, 2019 


Yesterday afternoon, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, announced that she would be launching an impeachment inquiry into the conduct of United States President Donald Trump. Pelosi had previously opposed impeachment proceedings.


Pelosi called Trump's conduct a ""breach of his Constitutional responsibilities,"" according to NBC. ""[T]he House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,"" she announced. Specifically, she was directing six of the House's committees to ""proceed with their investigations under [the] umbrella"" of impeachment. 


Members of the House Judiciary Committee do not all agree on how impeachment inquiries work. Republican committee member Doug Collins of Georgia said on Twitter, ""Until the full House votes to authorize an inquiry, nobody is conducting a formal inquiry."" Democratic committee chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York has repeatedly maintained an impeachment inquiry is what the committee is already doing.


The New York Times reported that, in a phone call in late July, Trump might have encouraged newly elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, who served as Vice President from 2008 until 2016. Joe Biden is a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election. Trump characterized the call with Zelensky as ""perfectly fine and routine.""


Trump, responding to Pelosi's announcement via Twitter, attacked the impeachment investigation as ""Witch Hunt garbage.""


Impeachment is the process by which a federal official, including the president, can be removed from office by Congress. The United States Constitution specifies that officials are removed from office after being impeached for, and convicted of, ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" A simple majority of the House of Representatives is needed to impeach an official, who can then be removed from office after a trial in the Senate, if two-thirds of the senators vote for removal.


In the history of the United States, only two presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Johnson was impeached over perceived violations of the Tenure of Office Act of 1867, which the Supreme Court later ruled to be unconstitutional. The vote to remove him from office failed by one vote. In 1998, Clinton was impeached for lying to investigators and obstructing justice during the Lewinsky affair; the vote to remove him also failed. A third president, Richard Nixon, would have faced impeachment over the Watergate scandal but resigned before any impeachment vote.

This morning Jacques Chirac, who served as President of France for twelve years, died at home in Paris, France, surrounded by family. He was 86. The news came from his son-in-law, Frédéric Salat-Baroux, and came after a long period of health problems. He had not made public appearances since 2014, which his wife Bernadette said was due to memory problems.


Jacques Chirac was born in 1932 in Paris. He was a civil servant before becoming a career politician. From 1967 to 1995 he was a member of the French Parliament during which he twice served as prime minister, first under President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in the seventies and again in the eighties under President François Mitterrand. Additionally, Chirac was mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995.


In 1995, Chriac was elected to his first of two terms as President of France. During his presidency he ended mandatory military service and cut two years off the length of presidential terms, down to five years. He favored European integration and sought a more federal European Union. Chirac was also an outspoken opponent of the United States-led Iraq War in 2003.


Chirac was convicted of corruption, stemming from his years as mayor, in 2011. The charges were held back while he was president due to presidential immunity. He was given a two-year suspended sentence.


Both houses of the French Parliament held a minute of silence in Chirac's honor today. Assembly president Richard Ferrand in relaying the news to parliament said, ""Jacques Chirac is part of the history of France"". Former president Nicolas Sarkozy said of Chirac, ""He incarnated a France that was true to its universal values and to its historic role"".

Yesterday, the Parliament of New South Wales (NSW), Australia voted to pass the ""Reproductive Health Care Reform Bill 2019"" which decriminalized abortion.  Until the new legislation, NSW had the most restrictive anti-abortion law in Australia.  The NSW legislature in Sydney abolished any existing common law rules about abortion and legalized terminations up to week 22 of a pregnancy.


Since 1900, under the state's criminal code, abortions were only allowed if a doctor determined the mother was in danger, either mentally or physically. The bill was drafted by Alex Greenwich who said on the parliament floor, ""It follows decades of work from women's rights campaigners, activists and people in the Parliament"". The upper house debate involved 102 amendments, and was amongst the longest they have ever debated a bill.


Member of parliament (MP) Kevin Conolly said a law allowing the termination of a life marked a ""sad day for NSW"". Former prime minister Tony Abbott said, ""It is a license for sex-selection abortions. It is a license for late-term abortion [...] It is effectively infanticide on demand."" 


MP Penny Sharpe, who co-sponsored the bill, said, ""The current law has meant women and doctors have a threat of 10 years in jail for making this decision and that's not okay"". Early opponent MP Tanya Davies said, ""We have moved the bill to a better place"".


Premier Gladys Berejiklian was not present at the bill's final vote.


New South Wales is the most populated Australian state. The state of South Australia still limits abortions to cases with two doctors' approval.

On Thursday, Hatice Cengiz, fiancée of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, addressed reporters in New York, New York, calling for the killers of Khashoggi to be brought to justice. Cengiz traveled to New York for the United Nations (UN) General Assembly which took place this week. Khashoggi was murdered last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Hatice Cengiz is a Turkish national now living in London.


The previous day, television broadcaster PBS revealed that in December, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman of Saudi Arabia accepted responsibility for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi but did not say he'd ordered it.  Speaking to Martin Smith of PBS, he said, ""It happened under my watch. I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch."" The official position remained that rogue operatives within the Saudi government committed the murder. According to Reuters and NBC, Mohammad bin Salman is the de facto Saudi ruler.


Cengiz called Mohammad's admission a ""political maneuver."" She explained, ""By confessing this, he's also distancing himself from the killing of Jamal [...] He's saying that it happened under his watch but he means he is not involved in this crime."" She credited news media with keeping the story alive. Speaking to NBC News, she said, ""His fellow journalists did their best that so no one could push this under the carpet [...] But at the end of the day, all of these efforts did not persuade world leaders to sanction Saudi Arabia. That is so sad"".


""What is so sad for me"", Cengiz said, ""is not seeing the punishment of the perpetrators [...] Imagine that the entire world remains silent over Jamal's killing. This silence and inertia created huge disappointment on my side.""


Agnès Callamard, a UN rapporteur for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights who had investigated the case, cautioned justice does not come swiftly. ""True justice takes time and I know it's painful, but that's the reality of the world we live in,"" she said, asking Cengiz to be ""patient and resilient.""


The CIA and other intelligence agencies reportedly believe the crown prince ordered Khashoggi's killing. Callamard encouraged the CIA to release the files from their investigation. A closed-door trial is underway in Saudi Arabia in which eleven individuals have been charged with the murder, however Callamard did not give it any credence.


Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi national, was a columnist for The Washington Post, and he lived in self-imposed exile in Virginia as a legal resident of the United States. He entered the consulate in Istanbul on October 2 2018, seeking documents allowing him to marry Turkish national Hatice Cengiz. He never came out. Saudi Arabia initially denied all claims that Khashoggi was slain, however, a UN report eventually concluded evidence supported his murder and dismemberment inside the consulate by Saudi agents. To date, his remains had not been recovered.

On Friday in Pakistan, Mohammed Waseem, brother of social media personality and feminist Qandeel Baloch, was sentenced for her murder to life in prison by a court in Multan.  Waseem confessed to killing his sister by strangling her in 2016 in what has widely been called an honor killing.  She was 26.


Baloch and Waseem's mother, Anwar, wept upon hearing her son had been convicted and said she believed he was innocent.  In August, the parents tried to have Waseem released by saying they forgave him for the killing.  Until recently, Pakistani law allowed the perpetrators of honor killings to go unpunished if forgiven by the victim's family.


Even though Waseem confessed to acting alone, several alleged accomplices, including Muslim cleric Mufti Abdul Qawi, were tried by the same court.  All, including Qawi, were acquitted.  Baloch was murdered a few weeks after publicly posting pictures of herself with Qawi on the Internet, and Qawi drew criticism for associating with her.  Qawi was later accused of inciting the murder in some way, which he denied.  Some of Qawi's supporters threw flower petals as he was leaving the courthouse.


Waseem appeared in a news conference after his 2016 arrest in which he expressed no regret for his sister's death and specifically mentioned family honor. He has since said his initial confession was forced.


""As women we must stand up for ourselves. As women we must stand up for each other[,]"" Baloch wrote on social media shortly before her death. ""I believe I am a modern day feminist.""


Qandeel Baloch made videos and social media posts depicting her dancing, singing, lying in bed or, on one occasion, offering to disrobe if Pakistan defeated India in a then-upcoming cricket match, all of which are considered controversial for women in Pakistan.


When Baloch was born, about 250 miles (400 km) southwest of Lahore, she was Fouzia Azeem, daughter to a poor farming family.  At the time of her murder, Qandeel Baloch, nicknamed the ""Kim Kardashian of Pakistan,"" had about 750,000 followers on Facebook, and wrote about feminism.  In an interview with Dawn, she said as a teenager she was forced into an abusive marriage by her family. She also said that her much-older husband attempted to disfigure her with acid.  Baloch ran away from the marriage to a shelter with her son but later returned the boy to her husband when she could not support him.


Since Baloch's death, Pakistan's laws about honor killings have changed.  Though the accused can still avoid the death penalty if forgiven by the victim's family, the minimum prison sentence for the crime even if forgiven is now 25 years.  Waseem is eligible to appeal.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/U.S._House_issues_subpoena_to_secretary_of_state_as_special_envoy_to_Ukraine_resigns,2019-09-30,U.S. House issues subpoena to secretary of state as special envoy to Ukraine resigns,"Monday, September 30, 2019 


Friday, the United States House of Representatives issued a subpoena for documents from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as part of its impeachment investigation into alleged misconduct by sitting President Donald Trump. On the same day, Kurt Volker, the United States special envoy for Ukraine negotiations, resigned without public explanation. The House issued a deposition request for Volker, scheduled for this week.


Volker's resignation was the first since details emerged about Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Volker's position as special envoy, an unpaid part-time role, put him in center of the Trump administration's affairs in Ukraine. In July, he helped facilitate a meeting between Giuliani, claiming to represent the State Department, and Andriy Yermak, one of President Zelensky's aides. Volker also worked to arrange a meeting between Zelensky and Trump himself during President Trump's planned trip to Warsaw, which was cancelled.


The subpoena was issued jointly by Representatives Eliot Engel, Adam Schiff, and Elijah Cummings, who serve as chairmen of the House's committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform, respectively. It follows repeated failed attempts to obtain documents from the State Department through previous document requests. Among other things, the House subpoenaed a full transcript of a call between Trump and then-newly elected President Zelensky in late July. It also called for records relating to the Trump administration's temporary withholding of security aid to Ukraine, as well as files relating to attempts by Rudy Giuliani to encourage investigations into Democratic challenger former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is one of the front runners for the Democratic Party's nomination for president in the upcoming 2020 race. Giuliani was serving as Trump's personal lawyer at the time. The New York Times reports that more subpoenas are likely to be issued in the coming week.


According to a whistle-blower complaint, Trump may have misused his office. Last week the White House released a summary of a phone call made by President Trump late last July to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In it, Trump asks Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Shortly before the conversation, Trump had ordered his staff to delay around US$400 million in military aid that had been slated for Ukraine, which is currently in a military conflict with Russia.


The accusation against Biden is that, during his time as President Barack Obama's vice president, he called for the government of Ukraine to reduce corruption but at the same time interfered with an investigation into Burisma Holdings; Hunter Biden was on the board of the company at the time. An investigation by PolitiFact found no such action on Joe Biden's part, and the investigation into Burisma had already been inactive for more than a year before Biden involved himself in Ukraine's politics in this way.


Trump said that he did indicate to the Ukrainians that the aid was contingent on their addressing corruption but denied that he made any specific deal about the Bidens. ""I put no pressure on them whatsoever,"" he told the press. ""I could have. I think it would probably, possibly have been OK if I did. But I didn't. I didn't put any pressure on them whatsoever.""


While in New York City to attend the United Nations General Assembly, President Zelensky told reporters, ""Nobody can put pressure on me because I am the president of an independent state. The only one person by the way who can put pressure on me [...] is my son, who is six years old.""


Regarding Trump's phone call, former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said via Twitter: ""If I got a transcript like the Trump-Ukraine call in a regular criminal case for bribery or extortion, I'd think, 'Wow, I’m surprised they're discussing this so openly and clearly.' ""


""The only conclusion I can reach after reading that devastating call summary is that Trump's White House staff want him to resign or be impeached,"" tweeted former thinktank executive Ken Gude. ""That's the only explanation I can come up with for why they would release this call summary.""


According to a poll published by NBC News last week, over 220 members of the House of Representatives favored some form of impeachment. One of the Representatives was an independent; the rest were from the Democratic Party. Together, the number of members is enough for the simple majority vote required by the United States Constitution to impeach an official.  Some reported wanting to draft articles of impeachment, while others preferred an investigation by either the House Judiciary Committee or another body. Since then, a Republican, Mark Amodei, has publicly voiced support for the impeachment inquiry, telling the Nevada Independent: ""I'm a big fan of oversight, so let's let the committees get to work and see where it goes."" He continued by noting that ""Using government agencies to, if it's proven, to put your finger on the scale of an election, I don't think that’s right [...] If it turns out that it's something along those lines, then there's a problem.""


Under the U.S. Constitution, the House of Representatives impeaches the official and then the impeachment trial is conducted in the Senate. The only punishments an impeachment trial may lay down are removal from office and prohibition from holding office in the future. They do not impose fines or prison terms. No U.S. president has ever been removed by impeachment, but eight federal judges have. Two-thirds of senators must vote to convict in the trial for removal from office.

Yesterday, Karsten Warholm of Norway won the 400 metres hurdles final at the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar. This was a successful defense of his 2017 title won in London, United Kingdom. The World Athletics Championships are held every other year.


Warholm, who is 23 years old, won the gold medal with a time of 47.42 seconds. The silver medal was won by Rai Benjamin from the United States, who finished the race in 47.66 seconds. Third place and the bronze medal went to Abderrahman Samba of Qatar with a time of 48.03 seconds.


Speaking to BBC Sport, Warholm said, ""This was a very tough race. I actually felt my heart was going to stop [...] I thought 'I'm going to die but it's going to be worth it'."" He also commented on the future, ""This is only the beginning and I am very lucky to win [...] It's deserved but in the future these guys will be tougher to beat. Tomorrow I have to get up and work again. That is what I love.""


Earlier this year, Warholm set a personal best time of 46.92 seconds in the 400 m hurdles, the second-fastest time recorded in the history of the event. The world record stands at 46.78 seconds and belongs to Kevin Young. This record has stood since 1992.

Today, as Hurricane Lorenzo hit the Azores, Met Éireann, the national meteorological service for Ireland, issued weather alerts as the storm approached from the west. Yellow warnings were issued nationwide, while six counties on the coast received orange warnings. The warnings apply from tomorrow night into Friday morning.


The Azores — autonomous islands of Portugal in the Atlantic Ocean — closed schools and non-essential public services. ""The situation will worsen in the next few hours"", said Vasco Cordeiro, the regional president, as the storm bore down on the Azores. Authorities expected winds of 100 mph (about 160 km/h) and high waves.


The orange warning issued by Met Éireann applied to County Galway, County Mayo, County Clare, County Cork, County Kerry and County Limerick and starts at 6 p.m. local time (1700 UTC) tomorrow. Though Lorenzo was forecast to diminish from a hurricane to a tropical storm, gusts of wind were forecast to reach 60–80 mph (about 95–130 km/h). ""Storm Lorenzo will produce significant swell, high waves and sizeable storm surges. This will lead to wave overtopping, some coastal flooding and damage, especially along western and southern coasts"", read the warning. The warnings called for gale force winds and heavy rain.


Hurricane Lorenzo reached Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson scale this past Saturday, but was downgraded to Category 1 as of this morning. According to reports, Lorenzo is the largest and strongest tropical cyclone to reach this far into the northeastern Atlantic in recorded history.

For the first time in the sixteen weeks of protests in Hong Kong, police fired and landed a live round on a protester yesterday.  The victim, eighteen-years-old and a high school student, was taken to the hospital for emergency surgery and is reported to be in critical condition.  The shooting took place in the Tsuen Wan district. Although the police have used force against protesters before, this is the first report of a protester being shot with live ammunition.


Footage from the City University Student Union showed a group of protesters throwing things as they ran away from police. The video showed a single police officer surrounded by protesters; he then drew his pistol, pointed it, and shot at one person.  This person fell to the ground as the other protesters ran away.


Police Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan said at a press conference: ""The police officers' lives were seriously threatened. To save his own and his colleagues' lives, he fired a live shot at the attacker."" Amnesty International has called for an investigation into the shooting.


In other parts of the city, the police used water canons and tear gas against protesters.  Some protesters responded by throwing things, including Molotov cocktails, but others only shielded themselves with umbrellas and did not return the attack.  Violence continued through the evening and the news network RTHK withdrew its reporters from the field after one of them was injured in the face. Sixty-six people or more were injured yesterday according to health officials, ranging in age from eleven to 75.


Yesterday was the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party's takeover of China.  On the mainland, it was celebrated as a holiday called National Day, but in Hong Kong it was met with protests and mourning.


The protests began in June in response to a proposed new law that would have allowed the Chinese government to extradite people accused of crimes from Hong Kong and try them under the mainland's legal system.  The protests have since transitioned to focus on other issues associated with Chinese encroachment on Hong Konger's rights, such as the way the Hong Kong legislature is elected, and on the actions of police toward protesters.

At least seven people were killed in the United States yesterday, when a World War II-era bomber crashed at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. The plane crashed near the end of a runway at 9:54 a.m. ET (1354 UTC) during an attempted landing, and struck a deicing facility at the airport, according to officials. The pilot was trying to land the plane about five minutes after takeoff. Fourteen people were injured in the crash, including all on board the plane, and one airport worker on the ground, according to Commissioner James Rovella of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.


According to Windsor Locks' first selectman, Chris Kervick, there were ten passengers and three crew members aboard the aircraft. Crash victims were transported by ambulance and by air to hospitals in the area, including Hartford Hospital, Bridgeport Hospital, and Saint Francis Hospital.


Dr. Steven Wolf at Saint Francis said, ""We received a mass casualty alert following the plane crash that took place near Bradley International Airport this morning. As a Level 1 Trauma Center, Saint Francis Hospital department has deployed all the necessary preparations in order to be ready to receive any number of patients.""


Bradley Airport was shut down after the incident and reopened later that day at 2 p.m. ET (1800 UTC). The airport is the second-largest airport in the New England region of northeastern United States.


Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said at a press conference after the incident, ""My heart really goes out to the families and we're going to give them the best information we can, as soon as we can, in an honest way [...] We're doing everything we can, and we've got an amazing group of people who are going to get to the bottom of this as soon as we can. You're in our prayers.""


The aircraft, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, is registered in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and was manufactured in 1944 according to Federal Aviation Administration records. According to a 1989 report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the same aircraft was involved in an incident in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania on August 23, 1987. The report said there was one passenger seriously injured, and two more with minor injuries; no crew were injured.


According to Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, the involved airplane is one of eighteen B-17s still in the United States. Blumenthal said the NTSB would begin an investigation at Bradley Airport, led by Board Member Jennifer Homendy.

On Wednesday, a United States federal judge sentenced a doctor based in Martinsville, Virginia to prison for 40 years for prescribing opioids illegally, after prescribing over half a million doses. He was given a fine of US$86,000. Three years of supervision after release was also mandated.


Dr. Joel Smithers was found guilty in May on 859 counts of illegally distributing opioids. This included prescriptions for oxycodone and oxymorphone tied to a West Virginia woman's death. Prosecutors said Smithers gave out the prescriptions to patients from five different states, some driving to his office from hundreds of miles away, from 2015 to 2017. United States Attorney Thomas T. Cullen said Smithers ""perpetuated, on a massive scale, the vicious cycle of addiction, despair, and destruction.""


Judge James Parker Jones, presiding in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia in Abingdon, handed down the sentence. Mandatory sentencing called for at least 20 years in prison and up to life in prison. The judge recommended mental health treatments and a prison near his family, according to WSET-TV. Smithers, 36 years old, is married and has five children.


Smithers testified in his own defense, claiming some patients deceived him. He also filed in court his intent to appeal.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Four_stabbed_to_death_at_Paris_police_headquarters,2019-10-05,Four stabbed to death at Paris police headquarters,"Saturday, October 5, 2019  

On Thursday at the headquarters of the Paris Police Prefecture in Paris, France, an IT worker went on a stabbing spree, killing four. A fifth person was hospitalized in critical condition. The attacker was shot dead by police. Three of the victims were male police officers and the fourth was a female office worker.


Officials said the three officers were stabbed with a kitchen knife in their offices. The woman was killed in a stairwell. The attacker, a man, reached the courtyard before he was shot in the head by another police officer. Local prosecutor Remy Heitz said the suspect's wife was taken into custody.


Officials said the man was 45 years old and born in the French territory of Martinique. He lived in Gonesse, a suburb of Paris. He was employed with the police since 2003 and was hearing impaired. According to Agence France-Presse, which cited sources close to the investigation, the man had converted to Islam a year-and-a-half ago.


The police headquarters, which is situated on an island in the river Seine, was blocked off after the attack. Cité station, part of the Paris Métro, was temporarily closed.


The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, wrote on Twitter: ""Paris is mourning its family this afternoon after this appalling attack on the [Police Prefecture]. The toll is heavy, several police lost their lives. In my name and that of the Parisians, my first thoughts go to the families of the victims and their relatives.""

In findings published on Wednesday in Science Advances, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) and University of South Carolina Beaufort, both in the United States, reported warming seas appear to decrease the efficacy of the chemical compounds that corals release into the water to defend themselves from bacteria and encroaching seaweed, but these losses may be mitigated if there are large numbers of hungry fish around.


The research was led by Mark Hay, a marine ecologist and Regents Professor at GT, who said ""There is a lot of argument now about whether local management can help in the face of global stresses — whether what a Fijian village does matters when people in London and Los Angeles burn fossil fuels to drive to work"". Hay added, ""Our work indicates that local management provides a degree of insurance against global stresses, but there are likely higher temperatures that render the insurance ineffective.""


The researchers examined three types of coral in reefs off the coast of Fiji, Acropora millepora, Porites cylindrica, and Pocillopora damicornis.  Some of these reefs were in areas where fishing was prohibited and some were not.  The researchers found when fish were plentiful, they would eat algae and seaweed off the corals, which appeared to leave them more resistant to the bacterium Vibrio coralliilyticus, a bacterium associated with bleaching.


The researchers suggested the algae, like warming temperatures, might render the corals' chemical defenses less effective, and the fish were protecting the coral by removing the algae.  They reported, ""Macroalgae are suggested to disrupt coral microbiomes via transfer of allelochemicals or microbes or release of dissolved organic carbon that affects microbial growth"".


P. cyclindrica and P. damicornis are known to be function under conditions that damage other corals and A. millepora is not.


Each reef-building coral unit is a collection of polyps living in symbiotic partnership with zooxanthellae algae.  The polyp, a cnidarian as are jellyfish, provides stinging protection and secretes a calcium shell, and the algae performs photosynthesis, produces oxygen and gives the coral its color.  Changing ocean environments have led to a phenomenon called coral bleaching when warmer waters cause the cnidarian to expel the algae from its body, which turns the coral reefs white.  This does not kill the cnidarian partner but does leave it badly weakened and vulnerable to disease.

On Thursday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) — the supreme court on matters of European Union (EU) law — ruled in regard to the case ""Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek vs. Facebook Ireland Limited"". The Luxembourg-based court issued a judgement favorable to the plaintiff, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, a politician in Austria, allowing an Austrian court to require social media site Facebook to remove a post from its site made by a user in Ireland. The ruling made proclamations which analysts say could have far-reaching implications for regulation of content on the Internet beyond the borders of the EU. The court's decision cannot be appealed.


In 2016, a Facebook user registered from Ireland shared publicly a news article from the Austrian news site oe24.at along with some comments of their own. The post, which was about Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, the then chair and spokesperson for The Greens, could potentially be seen by anyone with access to Facebook. The comments called her political party facsist and termed her a ""corrupt oaf"" and a ""lousy traitor"".


Glawischnig-Piesczek sued in Austria for defamation and won. Facebook was ordered to remove the post which it did by making it unavailable to view in Austria only. This apparently did not appease Glawischnig-Piesczek. As a result, the Supreme Court of Justice (Oberster Gerichtshof ) of Austria brought the case before the ECJ, asking for clarifications of EU law.


The EU law Electronic Commerce Directive 2000 provides liability protections for hosting sites. In its finding, the ECJ set rules for compliance with rulings from a court from any EU member nation for any website which hosts user content:


 By today’s judgment, the Court of Justice answers the Oberster Gerichtshof that the Directive on electronic commerce, which seeks  to  strike a balance between the different  interests  at stake, does not preclude a court of a Member State from ordering a host provider:


 – European Court of Justice

According to the ruling, a host, such as Facebook, must remove the original post as well as re-posts and posts which state essentially the same thing if it is deemed against the law. Steve Peers of the University of Essex, speaking to BBC, said, ""If there's a court order to say that someone's been defamed, then Facebook has to also search for different variations of it"", also observing, ""[t]here's no harmonised defamation law internationally"".


Jennifer Daskal of American University and contributor to Slate wrote, ""a single EU country (in this case Austria) could demand an online provider (in this case Facebook) to take down an objectionable post, monitor its site for equivalent content, and take down those postings as well. And it says a country could do so on a global scale, regardless of where the poster or the viewer is located. In so ruling, the court demonstrated a shocking ignorance of the technology involved and set the stage for the most censor-prone country to set global speech rules.""


Facebook released a statement which read, in part, ""This judgment raises critical questions around freedom of expression and the role that internet companies should play in monitoring, interpreting and removing speech that might be illegal in any particular country"". Facebook further claimed, ""It undermines the long-standing principle that one country does not have the right to impose its laws on speech on another country"".

Yesterday morning, English drummer Ginger Baker died in a hospital at the age of 80. The news came from the Twitter account in his name and was independently confirmed by Associated Press with his daughter Nettie Baker. On September 25, it was reported Baker was hospitalized in critical condition. Baker was widely known as the drummer and co-founder of the rock band Cream, an early supergroup.


Baker, a life-long smoker and former heroin addict, suffered from health problems for years. The list of ailments included hearing loss, osteoarthritis, emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as heart problems for which he had surgery in 2016. Although known to have lived his latter years in South Africa, his daughter said he died in Britain without elaborating.


Ginger Baker was born Peter Edward Baker in Lewisham, London, in 1939. His father was killed in combat in 1943 during World War II. Baker — who was reportedly nicknamed Ginger due to his red hair — began playing drums in his teens. In a story he sometimes told, he had a habit of tapping on school desks. When an opportunity arose at a party, his classmates encouraged him to sit down at a drum set. ""I'd never sat behind a kit before, but I sat down — and I could play! One of the musicians turned round and said, 'Bloody hell, we've got a drummer', and I thought, 'Bloody hell, I'm a drummer' "", he recalled in a 2009 retelling of the story to the The Independent.


Baker began his career as a drummer in jazz bands. He played with Acker Bilk and Terry Lightfoot. In 1962, when fellow drummer Charlie Watts was leaving Blues Incorporated for The Rolling Stones, Watts recommended Baker to be his replacement. Later, Baker found early success with rhythm and blues band The Graham Bond Organisation where he met bassist Jack Bruce.


In 1966, Baker, Bruce and singer/guitarist Eric Clapton, who was known from The Yardbirds, formed Cream. The rock trio was a massive success, selling tens of millions of records, including the first ever platinum certified album Wheels of Fire. Cream recorded four albums, then in 1968 disbanded with Baker and Bruce having developed a volatile relationship. Clapton and Baker were subsequently in another supergroup Blind Faith with Steve Winwood and Ric Grech. Blind Faith recorded only one studio album but notably played before a crowd of a hundred thousand at a free concert in London's Hyde Park.


In the 1970s, Baker moved to Nigeria where he established a studio and began playing polo. Here he collaborated with Fela Kuti and worked on Wings's album Band on the Run with Paul McCartney of The Beatles fame. Later, he recorded with John Lydon's Public Image Ltd.


Cream was inducted in 1993 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band reunited in 2005 for several London and New York concerts. Afterwards he moved to South Africa, and still lived there when the 2012 documentary Beware of Mr. Baker was filmed. Baker's last recording was 2014's Why? solo album. Baker retired from live performances in 2016 due to his ill health.


Paul McCartney wrote on Twitter, ""Ginger Baker, great drummer, wild and lovely guy. We worked together on the 'Band on the Run' album in his ARC Studio, Lagos, Nigeria. Sad to hear that he died but the memories never will.""


""A very sad loss, and my condolences to his family and friends. A loss also for his contribution to music. He was well-grounded in jazz from very early on,"" wrote Steve Winwood in a statement. ""Beneath his somewhat abrasive exterior, there was a very sensitive human being with a heart of gold. He’ll be missed.""


Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones also reacted on Twitter, ""Sad news hearing that Ginger Baker has died, I remember playing with him very early on in Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated. He was a fiery but extremely talented and innovative drummer.""

Friday evening, mockumentary Mister America had its world premiere at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, California as part of Hulu's Beyond Fest film festival. Mister America is a continuation of the elaborate multimedia universe of Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington's web series On Cinema at the Cinema. Wikinews attended the premiere.


The film follows a fictionalized version of comedian Tim Heidecker who hosts the absurd and shallow On Cinema film review Web series with purported film expert Gregg Turkington. When Heidecker narrowly avoids a murder conviction, he sets out to run for District Attorney of San Bernardino County and fails to even be on the ballot.


The premiere was accompanied by a question-and-answer session moderated by Canadian comedian Nathan Fielder, delving into the logistics of shooting with a five-person crew over the course of three days on a shoestring budget. Fans in the audience probed the stars about their comedic backgrounds, including Turkington's alias of insult comedian Neil Hamburger and Heidecker's interest in political comedy.


In addition to the cast of the film, additional On Cinema alumni including Alessandro Serradimigni, Joe Estevez, and Manuel Giusti were in attendance.


The Beyond Fest 2019 continues through October 8 and Mister America debuts to a wider audience on October 9.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/US_President_Trump_announces_troop_withdrawal_from_Syria,2019-10-08,US President Trump announces troop withdrawal from Syria,"Tuesday, October 8, 2019 


██ Syrian Arab Republic

██ Syrian opposition & Turkish occupation

██ Syrian Democratic Forces

██ Tahrir al-Sham

Late on Sunday, the United States President Donald Trump, in a statement delivered via the press secretary, announced US troops would be leaving Syria. The announcement was made after Trump had a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The statement also said US troops had defeated ISIS and Turkey would be moving into Northern Syria. Turkey would also take over guarding captured ISIS fighters which, the statement said, European nations have refused to repatriate.


The US had been allied with Kurdish groups in fighting ISIS. One of these groups, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), opposed the withdrawal and said it was previously given ""assurances from the US that it would not allow any Turkish military operations against the region."" Kino Gabriel said, ""The statement was a surprise and we can say that it is a stab in the back for the SDF.""


According to the BBC, the SDF is largely made up of YPG militia which support the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK is banned in Turkey. According to a statement released by Erdogan's office, ""neutralizing the threat stemming from PKK-YPG terrorist"" is an aim of the Turkish military operation. The other primary goal is a safe zone to repatriate Syrian refugees.


According to CNN, Turkey has an estimated two million Syrian refugees, down from a peak of over three-and-a-half million at the height of the Syrian Civil War. The Turkish statement called for the safe zone for refugees to be set up East of the Euphrates River, which is territory controlled by the SDF.


Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley wrote on Twitter, ""We must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake.""


Brett McGurk, who was Trump's Special Presidential Envoy to the international military intervention against ISIL until December, also  criticized the decision via Twitter. ""The WH statement tonight on Syria after Trump spoke with Erdogan demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of anything happening on the ground. The ""United States"" is not holding any ISIS detainees. They are all being held by the SDF, which Trump just served up to Turkey."" McGurk later wrote, ""The SDF suffered thousands of casualties in the Raqqa battle. Not a single American life was lost. Trump later expanded the operation down the ERV. He touts these operations in political rallies but without apparent thought as to who did the fighting and dying.""


Trump, also on Twitter, defended his decision, ""As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done [it] before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!""


Senator Lindsey Graham spoke on Fox News, ""This is going to lead to ISIS' reemergence. Nothing [is] better for ISIS than to create a conflict between the Kurds and Turkey. The Kurds will now align with [Bashir al] Assad because they have nobody to count on because we abandoned them. So this is a big win for Iran and Assad — a big win for ISIS.""


""ISIS is not defeated [...] The biggest lie being told by the administration [is] that ISIS is defeated. The caliphate's destroyed, but there's thousands of fighters over there. And no, the caliphate would not have been destroyed without the Kurds, and I applaud the president for getting the Kurds and the Arabs to do most of the fighting. The [US] casualties destroying the caliphate was very low"", Graham continued. ""[T]his impulsive decision by the president has undone all the gains we’ve made, thrown the region into further chaos. Iran is licking their chops. And if I’m an ISIS fighter I've got a second lease on life. So to those who think ISIS has been defeated you will soon see.""

At midnight local time (0700 UTC), United States public utility Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) began turning off electricity for customers in the San Francisco area of California. PG&E stated it scheduled the blackouts in response to forecasts for high winds amid dry conditions. The aim is to reduce the risk of wildfires. Nearly 800 thousand customers were scheduled to be affected by the shutoffs which were expected to last through at least midday tomorrow.


Within the first four hours 185 thousand customers were without power. According to PG&E's schedule, by noon today over half a million could be affected, at which point phase two was planned to begin. Phase two was planned to affect over two hundred thousand customers. A phase three was tentatively planned, but final decisions were not yet made.


PG&E announced the schedule in a press release late yesterday and followed it up with a press conference last night. Sumeet Singh, a vice president at PG&E, said ""We very much understand the inconvenience and difficulties such a power outage would cause"". Company meteorologist Evan Duffey said, ""This is forecast to be the strongest offshore wind event since October 2017"".


Senior vice president Michael Lewis added, ""The safety of our customers and the communities we serve is our most important responsibility, which is why PG&E has decided to turn power off to customers during this widespread, severe wind event. We understand the effects this event will have on our customers and appreciate the public's patience as we do what is necessary to keep our communities safe and reduce the risk of wildfire"".


According to local news, school districts across the area announced school closings. PG&E announced via Twitter around 11:30 am (1830 UTC), phase one had been completed. The company apologized for its website being inaccessible due to high volume of traffic.

On Tuesday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winners of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics in Stockholm, Sweden. The prize was shared between James Peebles and the duo of Didier Queloz and Michel Mayor. They are to share a monetary award of SEK9 million (approximately GBP738 thousand or USD910 thousand) from the Nobel Foundation.


Canadian-US scientist James Peebles won his half of the prize for his work in predicting cosmic microwave background and creating a theoretical framework from which other scientists have been able to calculate the age and structure of the universe, including the calculation that the universe is 95% dark matter and dark energy. He is a professor at Princeton University.


Queloz and Mayor, both from Switzerland, won their prize for discovering the first known exoplanet in 1995. The planet they found was 51 Pegasi b, a Jupiter-like gas giant some 50 light years away from Earth. Since their discovery, according to the academy, over four thousand other exoplanets have been discovered. Both are professors at the University of Geneva; Queloz is also a professor at the University of Cambridge.


""Both these prizes [...] tell us something essential, something existential about our place in the Universe"", said selection committee member Ulf Danielsson. ""The first one, tracing the history back to an unknown origin, is so fascinating. The other one tries to answer these questions about: 'are we alone — is there life anywhere else in the Universe?' ""

On Monday, United States District Court Judge Victor Marrero issued a ruling against President Donald Trump finding that New York City prosecutors could view his tax records after a subpoena issued by a grand jury. The Manhattan district attorney's office is investigating Trump over alleged hush money paid to two women with whom he has been alleged to have had affairs. Such payments could be considered bribery. President Trump sued Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr. and his own tax preparer Mazars USA to block the release of eight years of tax returns to the grand jury, but Judge Marrero dismissed the president's lawsuit. The president's legal team appealed the decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued an administrative stay to Marrero's order about an hour and a half after the district court ruling.


The appeals court ruling placed a stay on the district court's ruling until it hears arguments from the president's lawyers and District Attorney Vance's office. According to a court clerk, arguments in the case would be scheduled as soon as the week of October 21, with briefs from both parties due in the intervening time until then.


Trump had asked the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York intervene in a New York City criminal proceeding, in which a subpoena had been issued to Trump's tax preparer. He sought such intervention to prevent Mazars from releasing his tax returns, arguing that, as president, he should be immune from prosecution, and that, by extension, his tax preparer, Mazars USA, could likewise be exempt from investigation. Marrero rejected this argument:


 The notion of federal supremacy and presidential immunity from judicial process that the President here invokes, unqualified and boundless in its reach as described above, cuts across the grain of [...] constitutional precedents. It also ignores the analytic framework that the Supreme Court has counseled should guide review of presidential claims of immunity from judicial process. Of equal fundamental concern, the President's claim would tread upon principles of federalism and comity that form essential components of our constitutional structure and the federal/state balance of government powers and functions. Bared to its core, the proposition the President advances reduces to the very notion that the Founders rejected at the inception of the Republic, and that the Supreme Court has since unequivocally repudiated: that a constitutional domain exists in this country in which not only the President, but, derivatively, relatives and persons and business entities associated with him in potentially unlawful private activities, are in fact above the law.


Because this Court finds aspects of such a doctrine repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values, and for reasons further stated below, it ABSTAINS from adjudicating this dispute and DISMISSES the President's suit.


 – United States District Judge Victor Marrero, ""Decision and Order""

Following Marrero's order, the appeals court issued a stay, delaying Mazars' compliance with the subpoena until it could review the case.


Trump responded to the ruling via Twitter, attacking the subpoena as a political strategy: ""The Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump.""


The Manhattan district attorney's office began its probe into Trump's financial affairs after his former lawyer Michael Cohen was convicted of federal campaign finance law violations connected to payments made to porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal to remain silent about alleged affairs with Trump. Cohen is serving a three-year-long prison sentence.


Trump has admitted to ordering the payments, according to prosecutors, but the U.S. Justice Department maintains a policy of not charging the sitting president with crimes.


In recent United States history, it has been customary, but voluntary, for presidential candidates to release their tax returns when running for office. Trump was the first president to refuse to do so since 1976. Trump has cited an Internal Revenue Service audit as prohibiting him from releasing them. The president has a lawsuit to prevent a New York State law from allowing the House of Representatives' Committee on Ways and Means from gaining access to his records.

On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the calls by United Kingdom officials asking the United States to waive diplomatic immunity for Anne Sacoolas. Sacoolas, who has immunity as a diplomat's wife, was involved in a traffic collision which killed motorcyclist Harry Dunn on August 27. She subsequently left the UK and returned to the US.


Prime Minister Johnson was questioned about the case while speaking to the press at a hospital in Watford. He said, ""I think everybody's sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss. I must answer you directly, I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.""


Johnson continued, ""And I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country. That's a point that we've raised or are raising today with the American ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly. And to anticipate a question you might want to raise, if we can't resolve it then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House."" The White House refers to the United States president's office.


Harry Dunn, a 19-year-old motorcyclist was struck by a Volvo XC90 driving on the wrong side of the road in Northamptonshire according to traffic camera footage. The crash happened around 8:30 p.m. BST (1930 UTC) on August 27. He died from his injuries at John Radcliffe Hospital a short time later. The wreck occurred near RAF Croughton which is a intelligence base used by both the Royal Air Force and the US Air Force.


Northamptonshire police were able to determine the Volvo had come from RAF Croughton and spoke with Anne Sacoolas as a suspect. She informed police she had diplomatic immunity, but ""that she had no plans to leave the country in the near future"". Normally, only embassy workers — and their spouses — in London have diplomatic immunity, but in a 1994 agreement it was extended to all US workers at RAF Croughton.


Despite the assurances, she and her husband Jonathan Socoolas left the country, police revealed on Saturday. Northamptonshire's chief constable Nick Adderley wrote to the US Embassy in London asking to waive her diplomatic immunity. Both he and the county's Police and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold, urged the immunity be waived. The embassy declined the request and said the Socoolas family left per advice from the United States Department of State.


Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the embassy to reconsider and spoke with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the case. The State Department gave its ""deepest sympathies"" and said immunity cases were afforded ""intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry"".


Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said on TV, ""She didn't purposely drive on the other side of the road... if she'd have stayed and faced us as a family we could have found that forgiveness... but forgiving her for leaving, I'm nowhere near."" Charles told the Daily Mail, ""All we need to do is ask her to come back. It’s not much to ask. She’s left a family in complete ruin. We’re broken.""

Yesterday, Indonesia's security minister Wiranto was stabbed, according to government authorities. Wiranto, who was visiting the town of Pandeglang in the province of Banten, survived the attack.


Wiranto suffered ""two deep wounds"" in the attack according to a hospital spokesperson. The local police chief and two others were also injured. Al Jazeera reported that Wiranto was flown to a hospital in Jakarta, and that his condition was stable.


Dedi Prasetyo, a spokesperson for the Indonesian National Police, confirmed that two suspects were arrested. He told the BBC that police suspect the attackers had been ""exposed to radicalism"". The BBC also cited Budi Gunawan, chief of the Indonesian State Intelligence Agency, as saying the suspects were linked to the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah network, which itself was related to the Islamic State.


The attack came less than two weeks before Indonesian President Joko Widodo's second term inauguration. Widodo designated Wiranto, a former general, as the nation's security minister in 2016. Al Jazeera reported that Widodo was planning to visit Wiranto, who was being treated at the Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital.

Yesterday, Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, announced the death of cosmonaut Alexei Leonov. Leonov was famous for performing the first human spacewalk as part of the Soviet Union's Voskhod 2 mission. He was 85.


Leonov, also known as ""cosmonaut No. 11"", was part of the Soviet Union's original team of cosmonauts. On March 18, 1965, he performed the first manned extravehicular activity (EVA), or ""spacewalk"", remaining alone outside the spacecraft for just over twelve minutes. He received the ""Hero of the Soviet Union"", the Soviet Union's highest honor, for his work. Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo–Soyuz mission symbolizing that the Space Race was over.


NASA interrupted its live coverage of an International Space Station spacewalk to mourn Leonov's passing. It also credited Leonov with making the spacewalk possible, noting on Twitter ""[h]is venture into the vacuum of space began the history of extravehicular activity"".


Sputnik News reported Leonov, who died in Moscow, will be buried at the Federal Military Memorial Cemetery on Tuesday. He was the last surviving member of the Voskhod programme crew.

In findings published Wednesday in Science Advances, researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder) in Colorado and the College of Wooster in Ohio reported a new mechanism by which warm ocean currents erode the ice shelves along the coast of Antarctica, contributing to the planet's rising oceans.


""Warm water circulation is attacking the undersides of these ice shelves at their most vulnerable points,"" said study co-author Karen Alley. The Wooster professor added, ""These effects matter [...] But exactly how much, we don't yet know. We need to."" 


The researchers used satellite imagery to identify places where coastal ice sheets had melted, creating areas of open water called polynyas, which, they observed, occurred in the same places every year.  From this, they concluded that warm water was reaching the ice sheets in the same places every year as well.


Because warmer water is more buoyant, says the study, it rises above cooler water, creating what the scientists describe as an ""upside-down river"" flowing underneath the layers of ice.  Ice shelves tend to weaken as they move, forming cracks and crevasses at their edges and stretch points.  Warm water, being on top, tends to become even more likely to find these cracks, so increasing the ice mass' melt rate.


Ice shelves are not actually part of the land mass with which they are associated.  Rather, they float along the coast nearby.  Because they can be prevented from drifting further away by high places in the ocean floor, they can in turn prevent land-associated ice masses from becoming detached.


""Now we're seeing a new process, where warm water cuts into the shelf from below,"" said study co-author Ted Scambos of CU Boulder's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES). ""Like scoring a plate of glass, the trough renders the shelf weak, and in a few decades, it's gone, freeing the ice sheet to ride out faster into the ocean.""

Yesterday, Eliud Kipchoge from Kenya ran a marathon in less than two hours. This is the first time anyone has been recorded to run a full marathon of 42.195 kilometers (approximately 26 miles) under this pursued landmark time. It was not, however, an officially sanctioned world record, as it was not an ""open race"" of the IAAF. His time was 1 hour 59 minutes 40.2 seconds.


Kipchoge ran in Vienna, Austria. It was an event specifically designed to help Kipchoge break the two hour barrier. Called the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, it featured 42 pacemakers — supporting runners. The team included top runners and Olympic champions. They ran with Kipchoge, alternating positions in a surrounding formation.


""They are among the best athletes in the world — so thank you,"" said Kipchoge after the run. ""I appreciate them for accepting this job. We did this one together."" He posted on Twitter, ""Today we went to the Moon and came back to earth! I am at a loss for words for all the support I have received from all over the world.""


Kipchoge also set the current official world record for a sanctioned race, of 2 hours 1 minute 39 seconds, last year in Berlin, Germany.

Yesterday, Brigid Kosgei of Kenya won the 2019 Chicago Marathon and broke the long-standing marathon world record for women competing in mixed-sex marathons. Kosgei was the Chicago Marathon defending champion. Countryman Lawrence Cherono won the men's division. The race was held in the United States city of Chicago, Illinois.


In setting the new record, Kosgei finished more than six minutes ahead of her competition, completing the race in 2:14:04. This was 81 seconds faster than Paula Radcliffe's mixed-sex mark set at the 2003 London Marathon. The women-only record of 2:17:01, held by Mary Jepkosgei Keitany also from Kenya, remained intact. The distinction between the two records is the use of male pacesetters.


""I was not expecting this"", said Kosgei after the race. ""But I felt my body was moving, moving, moving so I went for it. This is amazing for me."" Kosgei was joined by Paula Radcliffe at the finish line. ""[...] I always knew this time would come — and when I saw how fast Brigid was running I knew the record would go if she could maintain her pace"", Radcliffe said.


Second and third place went to Ababel Yeshaneh and Gelete Burka, both from Ethiopia, with times of 2:20:51 and 2:20:55, respectively. Winner of the men's division, Cherono, posted a time of 2:05:45. He was followed closely by Ethiopians Dejene Debela, 2:05:46, and Asefa Mengstu, 2:05:48.


Just the previous day, Kosgei's countryman Eliud Kipchoge became the first person to run a marathon in under two hours, setting the mark in Vienna, Austria at a special event; though Kipchoge's time was not considered an official world record, as it was not an open race sanctioned under IAAF rules.

Late on Sunday, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced it had entered into an agreement with the government of Syria after Turkey began a military offensive into north-eastern Syria on Wednesday. According to Syrian state media, government forces began deploying into previously SDF controlled territory yesterday. Also on Sunday, the United States announced a complete withdrawal from the region, beyond the withdrawal from the ""immediate area"" first announced seven days earlier on October 6.


In a statement, the SDF said, ""An agreement has been reached with the Syrian government — whose duty it is to protect the country's borders and preserve Syrian sovereignty — for the Syrian Army to enter and deploy along the Syrian-Turkish border to help the [SDF] stop [the Turkish] aggression"".


The Syrian Army — whose commander-in-chief is President Bashar al-Assad — entered Tell Tamer and Ain Issa yesterday according to state media. The SDF said hundreds of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) fighters escaped following Turkish airstrikes from a camp at Ain Issa.


On October 6, US President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke on the phone. Then both nations issued statements speaking of an imminent incursion into northeast Syria, and the US statement spoke of Turkey assuming the duty of guarding captured ISIS militants.


On Wednesday, Turkey began a military offensive with airstrikes followed by a ground invasion. Erdoğan said the invasion was ""to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area."" He named it ""Operation Peace Spring"" and named both the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) as terrorists. PKK is a banned militant organization in Turkey; YPG is the main fighting force of the SDF, largely Kurdish and, according to Turkey, supportive of the PKK. 


The operation was condemned by members of the European Union. Erdoğan cited Article 5 of the NATO treaty and said, ""They need to stand by us"", while addressing the press yesterday. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg wrote, ""I count on Turkey to act with restraint & ensure that the gains we have made in the fight against ISIS are not jeopardised.""

Today, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam delivered her annual policy speech. Speaking in the Legislative Council, Lam was interrupted by protesting legislators. The council was adjourned and Lam later delivered the speech via video. This was reportedly the first such occurrence.


Lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp shouted at Lam and projected slogans onto the walls of the council chambers. A number of legislators were removed. Council President Andrew Leung adjourned the session mere minutes into the speech as Lam left.


In the subsequent video broadcast of the speech, Lam said, ""any acts that advocate Hong Kong’s independence and threaten the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests will not be tolerated."" She further stated, ""So long as Hong Kong remains impeded by unresolved disputes, ongoing violence, confrontation and discord, our city cannot embark on the road to reconciliation and people will lose faith in the future […] We have to put aside differences and stop attacking each other"".


Lam also spoke on the economy. ""The Hong Kong economy has already slipped into a technical recession since the third quarter. In mid-August, the government lowered the economic growth forecast for 2019 to 0 – 1%"", she said, noting it was the worst their economy had performed since 2009. Lam also introduced housing and property initiatives to address concerns about rising prices.


Legislator Tanya Chan spoke to the press after the speech: ""I really urge [Lam], if she can’t govern Hong Kong, and has no determination to govern Hong Kong, and no ability or even capability of administrating Hong Kong, to please step down. This is the only way we can have a good future, the only way Hong Kong can go forward. Please, please Carrie Lam, please don’t let us suffer anymore. Please go.""


Regina Ip from the pro-Beijing camp said in a press conference: ""The behavior of my colleagues in disrupting the delivery of the policy address by the chief executive is anti-democratic and oppressive of the rights of the chief executive, and the rights and freedoms of myself and colleagues who want to listen to the policy address"".

Yesterday, authorities in the United Kingdom and the United States announced that 337 suspected users in 38 countries were arrested following an investigation of a dark web child pornography site. The website was based in South Korea and accepted cryptocurrency as payment. Law enforcement agencies from Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States were part of the international task force. The current phase of investigation and arrests began in 2018.


At the center of the case was a website known as ""Welcome To Video"" and its alleged operator Jong Woo Son from South Korea. According to authorities, the site hosted a quarter million video clips containing sexual abuse of children, including toddlers and infants. The site was said to have begun operations in June 2015. Authorities shuttered and seized the site in March 2018.


Jong Woo Son is already in prison in South Korea, but yesterday the United States Department of Justice unsealed further charges against him. United States Attorney Jessie K. Liu said, ""Children around the world are safer because of the actions taken by U.S. and foreign law enforcement to prosecute this case and recover funds for victims […] We will continue to pursue such criminals on and off the darknet in the United States and abroad, to ensure they receive the punishment their terrible crimes deserve.""


Nikki Holland of the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said, ""Dark web child sex offenders — some of whom are the very worst offenders — cannot hide from law enforcement. They're not as cloaked as they think they are, they're not as safe as they think they are."" It was the NCA's investigation of Matthew Falder which led to the discovery of the South Korean website.


Jong was arrested in March, 2018, but South Korea's National Police Agency when announcing the arrest in May, 2018 identified him only as ""Mr. A"" as the international investigation continued. Some of the site's users already pleaded guilty or were convicted before yesterday's announcements. Allegedly, Jong processed ₿7300 in membership fees and video purchases. As of this writing, one bitcoin is worth approximately US$8000 or €7000. The site also allegedly made use of Tor, a layered network designed to keep users anonymous.


US authorities claimed the site was the largest child pornography site in the world and that more than twenty active victims were rescued. Listed US states as having members from the site were: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Washington, D.C. They also stated arrests were made in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.


Despite the lengthy lists provided, neither US nor British authorities delivered a complete list of the 38 countries they said were involved.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/US_Representative_Elijah_Cummings_dies_at_age_68,2019-10-18,US Representative Elijah Cummings dies at age 68,"Friday, October 18, 2019 


Early yesterday morning, United States Representative Elijah Cummings died while in hospice care. Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, was 68.


Elijah Eugene Cummings, first elected to Congress in 1996, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1951. His parents, Robert Cummings Sr. and Ruth Elma Cummings, were sharecroppers. In grade school, Cummings expressed intent to become a lawyer. After receiving a bachelor's degree in political science from Howard University, he attended law school at the University of Maryland. Cummings passed the state bar exam in 1976, and went on to start his own law practice.


In 1982 Cummings successfully ran to be a state delegate, joining the Maryland General Assembly in 1983. He remained there for fourteen years, eventually serving as the speaker pro tem of the chamber. Cummings was the first African American to hold that office.


When Representative Kweisi Mfume of Maryland's seventh Congressional District announced his resignation in 1995, Cummings joined the race to replace him, winning the election. He went on to serve in the House of Representatives for twenty three years. He was among the Representatives who voted against the Iraq War in 2002, and in 2003 and 2004 served as the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. He was also a member of the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi.


Following Democratic victories in the 2018 midterm elections, Cummings became the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. In that role, Cummings oversaw the committee's impeachment inquiry into President Trump, alongside the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees.


The Baltimore Sun reported Cummings had been sick and was missing from Capitol Hill; his last roll call vote was on September 11. At 2:45 a.m. local time (0645 UTC), his office said, he died at Gilchrist Hospice Care. In a statement, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, his wife and the current chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party, said Cummings ""worked until his last breath"".


In response to Cummings's death, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, ordered the Capitol's flags be lowered to half staff. Flags at the White House were reportedly similarly lowered.


Politicians from across the political spectrum publicly mourned Cummings's death. Democrat Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, told MSNBC Cummings ""was a great man,"" while Republican President Trump noted his ""strength, passion and wisdom"" on Twitter.


Representative Carolyn Maloney, the most senior Democrat on the Oversight and Reform Committee, has stepped into Cummings's role as the committee's acting chair. As of yesterday evening, the process to select the next permanent chair had not yet been announced, according to the Baltimore Sun.


Under Maryland state law, Republican Larry Hogan, the current governor, has until October 28 to release plans for a special election to fill Cummings's congressional seat.

Elementary school students sang, Elder Nelson White provided a prayer, and the buffalo were released from a livestock trailer into a into a 48-acre space set aside for them in Kinnear.  These American bison, commonly called buffalo, came from the National Bison Range in western Montana run by the U.S. federal government.  The animals were transported more than 500 miles (800 km).


""With everything that's happened to our people, our language, our culture, we feel that bringing the buffalo back here is going to heal us[,]"" Crystal C'Bearing of the Northern Arapaho tribal historic preservation office told those gathered to watch the release.


The Arapaho have plans to widen the buffalo's range to 600 acres and report they are considering eventually pooling resources with the nearby Eastern Shoshone Tribe, who currently have a herd of 33 buffalo.


""I think [working with the Eastern Shoshone]'s definitely a possibility. There's no sense in having two private herds[,]"" said Devin Oldman, who helped manage the delivery of the buffalo. ""I would think that we would try to get our numbers up to one or two hundred before we do that so we have a nice strong herd.""


In the 1800s, the buffalo were hunted nearly to extinction not only for their valuable hides but also because many U.S. generals, including President Ulysses S. Grant, believed that removing the buffalo would undermine the economies of many of the Native American tribes that depended on them for food and goods and make it easier to push them onto reservations.

On Saturday, aftershocks of a powerful earthquake with reported magnitude 6.3 that struck southern Philippines on Wednesday night have increased the death toll of the extended event from five people to six due to a massive landslide following a 5.0 magnitude aftershock on Saturday.


On Wednesday, the strong tremor left five dead and, by early reports, at least 30 injured. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) of the Philippines increased the previous death toll to six following the landslide caused by the 5.0 earthquake. Meanwhile, the total reported casualties increased to 167 from a previous 93 injured people.


On Saturday, reports said Wednesday's quake affected the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Region 11 and Region 12. Over 2,000 residents near Mount Apo in Kidapawan City have been relocated to other villages in the city since Wednesday. 76 villages were affected according to NDRRMC report on Saturday, which figured 21 injured individuals in Davao del Sur, 36 in North Cotabato, 29 in South Cotabato and seven in General Santos City. Numbers of affected residents fear to return home due to the series of aftershocks, according to CNN Philippines.


In a situational report of NDRRMC, Wednesday's tremor damaged 143 buildings including 70 schools, 40 houses, seven health facilities, two worshiping areas, and ten commercial buildings. Rappler reported three malls in Davao City and Gaisano Mall in Digos City were damaged following aftershocks.


The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) reported the first quake occurred at 7:37 p.m. local time (1137 UTC) on Wednesday. Magnitude 6.3 according to Phivolcs, it was recorded as magnitude 6.4 by the US Geological Survey. It was followed by another earthquake an hour later; the second quake had a magnitude of 4.0 and was recorded in Sultan Kudarat. A 5.3-magnitude quake was recorded at 4:53 a.m Thursday morning (2053 Wednesday night, UTC) in Manay, Davao Oriental. 


According to Manila Bulletin, Wednesday's earthquake, at 6.3, was the strongest recorded impacting Kidapawan City. Phivolcs recorded 611 aftershocks as of Saturday 8:00 p.m. (1200 UTC).


In response, many schools were closed on Thursday and after, with the provincial government in North Cotabato suspending classes province-wide. Charles Federic Plotena, the mayor of Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat, announced classes for students ranging from kindergarten to high school, public and private, would be cancelled, while Sara Duterte, the mayor of Davao City, also cancelled graduate and post-graduate studies. 


Reportedly, at least two towns —including Makilala in the province of North Cotabato— declared a state of calamity following Wednesday's quake. Phivolcs said in its report, the western extension of Mindanao Fault makes the province seismically active, while the nearby Cotabato Trench contributes to earthquakes regionally.

On Monday, Canada held a general election to select the members of the House of Commons for the 43rd Canadian Parliament. The Liberal Party, which previously controlled a majority of the House of Commons, lost a net of 20 seats, according to preliminary reports, resulting in a minority government.


In early September, Julie Payette, the Governor General of Canada, dissolved the 42nd Canadian Parliament, triggering the elections. She did so at the request of Justin Trudeau, then the Prime Minister. 


1. Unofficial results
2. Relative to seats at dissolution
3. At dissolution, there was one MP of the People's Party of Canada, one MPof the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and 8 independent MPs


Trudeau heads the Liberal Party. Liberals, which had secured an absolute majority of seats in the House of Commons in the 2015 election, lost that majority. Instead, they secured a plurality of seats, but a minority.


The House of Commons includes 338 seats, each with a Member of Parliament, or MP. For a party to fully control the House of Commons, it needs an outright majority of 170 MPs.

In findings published Tuesday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, researchers in the United Kingdom established that poor hygiene by humans, specifically insufficient hand washing after defecation, is especially responsible for the spread of antibiotic-resistant — superbug — strains of Escerichia coli (E. coli) bacteria.


""We wanted to find out how these superbugs are spread — and whether there is a cross-over from the food chain to humans"" said lead author Professor David Livermore of the University of East Anglia's medical school. 


There are many strains of E. coli, and a large number are either harmless to humans or cause only mild health problems.  Infection with a pathogenic strain, however, can cause blood poisoning or other serious conditions.


In this work, scientists assessed the strains of E. coli from infected humans and looked for the same strains in sewage, dairy farm slurry, human faeces, and contaminated foods including beef, pork, chicken, salad and fruit from different parts of Great Britain.


""[T]he strains of resistant E. coli [found in food], were almost entirely different from the types found in human faeces, sewage and bloodstream infections"", said Dr. Livermore. ""[...] Rather — and unpalatably — the likeliest route of transmission for ESBL-E. coli is directly from human to human, with faecal particles from one person reaching the mouth of another.  We need to carry on cooking chicken well and never to alternately handle raw meat and salad. There are plenty of important food-poisoning bacteria, including other strains of E. coli, that do go down the food chain. But here — in the case of ESBL-E. coli — it's much more important to wash your hands after going to the toilet.""


According to a survey published in 2017 by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, 84% of surveyed Britons did not wash their hands well enough from a hygiene perspective — at least twenty seconds with soap and water.  Society President Ash Soni told the public, ""If we can reduce the number of illnesses where antibiotics are needed [...] we can reduce antibiotic resistance by saving these important medicines for when they are really required.""

On Friday, the United States Department of Transportation announced new restrictions on flights to Cuba. The new policy, which is to take effect on December 10, prohibits all flights to Cuba, with the exception of flights to the international airport in Havana.


US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent a letter requesting the new rules to Elaine Chao, the Secretary of Transportation; the new rules were released later the same day. In the letter, Pompeo cited the Cuban government's ""ongoing repression of the Cuban people and its support for Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela"" as his motivation. The new regulations do not apply to José Martí International Airport, for which Pompeo requested an exemption.


Bruno Parrilla, the foreign affairs minister of Cuba, responded to the new rules via Twitter: ""I strongly reject new #US blockade measure that bans #US airlines' flights to 9 Cuban airports [...] they won't extract any concession from us. We shall overcome!""


According to CBS, the delayed implementation of the new policy provides airlines with 45 days to wind down Cuban operations. American Airlines and JetBlue are among the airlines affected, as they both offer flights to Cuban cities other than Havana.


The move was the Trump administration's latest application of pressure on Cuba's government, following improved bilateral relations during the presidency of Barack Obama.

Yesterday, former United States Representative John Conyers died in his sleep, according to a family spokesperson. Conyers, the former Democratic Dean of the House of Representatives, was 90.


John James Conyers Jr., first elected to Congress in 1964, was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1929. After serving in the Korean War, he attended Wayne State University, receiving both a bachelor's degree and a law degree. He worked for three years for Representative John Dingell as an aide.


Conyers ran for Congress in 1964, winning by a margin of 108 votes. He took office 1965, and spent the next five decades in Congress. He spent his time in the House promoting civil rights legislation, and from 1965 Rosa Parks worked for his Detroit office for 23 years, till her retirement. Starting in 1968, he spent 15 years fighting for Martin Luther King Jr. Day to be a federal holiday; President Ronald Reagan signed Conyers's bill into law in 1983.


In 1971, Conyers co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus. He served as a member of the House Oversight Committee until 1995, then joined the House Judiciary Committee. He served as the chair of the Judiciary Committee while the Democratic party controlled the House from 2007 until 2011, and remained a member of the committee until he retired in 2017. According to Associated Press, Conyers was unique on the Judiciary Committee in having participated in the impeachment hearings of two different Presidents, Richard Nixon, in 1972, and Bill Clinton, in 1998.


In 2017, after sexual misconduct allegations came to light, Conyers resigned, referencing health issues. At the time, he had served in Congress longer than any other then-current member, earning him the distinction of Dean of the House of Representatives. NPR reported he had also served in Congress longer than any other African American, current or past.

Yesterday, former United States Senator Kay Hagan died, according to a statement released by her family. Hagan, North Carolina's first female Democratic Senator, was 66.


Hagan, first elected to Congress in 2008, was born on May 26, 1953 in Shelby, North Carolina. She received her undergraduate degree in 1975 from Florida State University, and then graduated from Wake Forest University in 1978 with a law degree.


In 1998, following ten years working for NationsBank, Hagan successfully ran for a seat in North Carolina's state Senate. A decade later, in 2008, Hagan defeated incumbent Republican US Senator Elizabeth Dole to become the first female Democratic US Senator from North Carolina. She served for one term before losing reelection to Thom Tillis, a Republican, in 2014.


According to Sadie Weiner, Hagan's former spokeswoman, Hagan died from Powassan virus, a flavivirus, leading to encephalitis (brain inflammation).

Yesterday, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution to establish procedural rules for the next, public phase of the ongoing impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump. 


Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House, announced the upcoming vote in a letter earlier this week to other Democratic members of the House. Pelosi herself presided over the vote, a move whose rarity, CBS noted, highlighted the significance of the resolution.


Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is to be in charge of presiding over public hearings.


The resolution passed primarily along party lines, with 231 Democrats supporting the resolution, and 194 Republicans opposing it; two Democrats opposed, and one independent supported. Republican Representatives attacked the impeachment inquiry, with Steve Scalise of Louisiana calling the investigation into Trump ""Soviet-style"" and Ross Spano of Florida calling the process ""a blatant and obvious coup to unseat a sitting president of the United States"". Trump repeatedly called the Democrats' investigation a ""witch hunt"", and on Twitter referred to the vote as ""The Impeachment Hoax"".


If the House of Representatives votes to impeach President Trump, he would then face trial in the Senate. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate Majority Leader, previously committed to proceeding with such a trial. Republicans hold a majority in the Senate, and for a trial to result in removal from office a two-thirds majority is needed.


The House has only impeached two Presidents in the history of the United States, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson. Both were acquitted in the Senate.

On Friday, Beto O'Rourke, who was a candidate in the Democratic primary for the 2020 United States presidential election, announced the end of his campaign. He made his announcement via a post on Medium, in which thanked his supporters.


O'Rourke dropped out ahead of the upcoming Democratic primary debate scheduled for November 20 in Georgia. According to reports, O'Rourke was not qualifying for the debate; two weeks before the November 13 deadline, O'Rourke had only reached 3 percent support in two qualifying polls, of which four are needed.


O'Rourke made gun control a key issue of his campaign. After a mass shooting near the border in August, the O'Rourke campaign cancelled events as O'Rourke returned home El Paso, Texas, where he is a former City Councillor. A month later, during the third primary debate, O'Rourke defended his proposal of a mandatory buyback program, saying that ""Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15.""


Reports said O'Rourke, a former United States Representative who gained national recognition during his 2018 run for Senate against Ted Cruz, does not plan to run for Senate in 2020.

On Monday, Hungarian daily newspaper Magyar Nemzet revealed a deal whereby, on October 29, Hungarian state-owned enterprise HDT Védelmi Ipari Kft. (HDT Limited) acquired Austrian mortar and shell manufacturer Hirtenberger Defence Group. Hirtenberger Defence Group also acknowledged the deal.


In the deal, Austrian, United Kingdom and New Zealand production sites are to be kept, with market sales expected to cover for the price in the long run. A government-guaranteed loan covered the costs, but the exact figure was kept secret.


The November 4 issue of Magyar Nemzet published an interview with Gáspár Maróth, the Hungarian Government commissioner responsible for defence, defence industries and coordinating defence modernization, in which the deal was announced. On the same day, the Hirtenberger Defence Group issued a corresponding press release.


While not naming any other bidders, Maróth said the Hungarian bid won after lengthy negotiations, out of mulitple competing offers. He said he expects no political turmoil between the neighboring Austria and Hungary over the sale. He also noted the acquisition fits into the Hungarian ""outward investment"" ((hu))Hungarian language: ‍tőkekihelyezési strategy of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.


The Austrian partner asked for the price to be kept secret, but the commissioner stated the purchase was financed by a loan, so it is not a burden on the state budget. With government resolution No. 1430/2019, the state issued an indemnity bond to cover for HDT's 38.8 million euro loan, and daily Népszava covered the story with a headline pointing out that amount as the presumed price. The creditor Hungarian Development Bank is state-owned as well. Already-queued orders won't leave idle capacity for some years, Maróth said, and paying back this loan seems realistic; unnamed industry experts called this dubious to Népszava, as the market is saturated and margins are thin, while noting this kind of equipment is needed by the Defence Forces.


The company structure remains unchanged and all sites continue to operate, but Hungarian engineers are to join the research and development team. Maróth pointed out it would have been much more costly and time-consuming to research mortar technology than to acquire it this way.  He noted, ""the army modernization does not just cover buying 'hardware' but technology transfer as well."" ((hu))Hungarian language: ‍a haderő modernizációja a „vas” megvétele mellett a tudástranszferre is kiterjed.

Népszava noted the purchase appeared to circumvent the Ministry of Defence. HDT Limited was registered on August 6, 2019 and is under the aegis of Hungarian National Asset Management, Inc.


To modernize its military, in 2018, Hungary licensed Czech firearm technology and started assembling firearms in Kiskunfélegyháza, then agreed with Airbus to open a helicopter parts factory as a joint venture in Gyula.


US President Trump has called for NATO members to increase military spending. According to a March 14, 2019 NATO press release, Hungary spent an estimated 1.15% of its GDP on military expenditures in 2018; NATO guidelines call for 2%. Maróth noted the military had been ""effectively disarmed"" ((hu))Hungarian language: ‍gyakorlatilag lefegyverzett by 2010, when Viktor Orbán regained the prime ministry of Hungary for his second term. Hungary launched a military development program dubbed ""Zrínyi 2026"" in 2017 to address structural and financial challenges faced by the Defence Force and to renew its equipment.

On Friday, the Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve released a statement saying an attack that day on an Iraqi air base housing U.S. military personnel near Mosul produced no casualties.


A spokesperson told the Military Times the attack took place at about 7:45 p.m. ""No Coalition troops were injured. We appreciate the Iraqi Security Forces immediate response and investigation. Coalition forces are in Iraq at the invitation of the Government of Iraq to defeat ISIS remnants;"" read the statement; ""we will not be deterred by these attacks and maintain the right to defend ourselves."" Seventeen rockets struck near the base, according to Iraqi military.


No organization immediately claimed credit for the attack, but some Iraqi militias associated with Iran had made threats against U.S. personnel.  The base is home to U.S. troops there to eliminate Islamic State elements in cooperation with Iraqi security forces.


This took place as anti-government protests continue in Baghdad and through the southern part of Iraq.  Protesters have claimed Iran, especially, amongst other outside parties, is unduly influencing their government and inducing politicians to act against Iraq's interests.  Their demands have included dissolving Parliament, appointing an election committee whose members are selected irrespective of party affiliation, and a clear date set for new elections. Protests are not reported in Mosul, in northern Iraq.


The protests began in early October, then went quiet for a few weeks, before resuming in late October. The news agency AFP has placed the protester death count in the hundreds.


The current government of Iraq was established in 2003 after a U.S.-led coalition ousted Saddam Hussein.  Iraq has some of the largest oil reserves of any country in the world, but a large portion of its populace suffers from power outages and lack of economic opportunity.  U.S. troops left Iraq in 2011, then at the Iraqi government's request returned three years later.  There are reportedly about 5000 U.S. troops now in the country.

The Lost 52 Project announced on Sunday that a sunken World War II-era submarine wreck they found last June was the remains of the U.S.S. Grayback.  The wreck was located about 50 miles (80 km) south of Okinawa, Japan at a depth of over 1400 feet (about 430 meters), far from where the Navy's records initially predicted it would be. The United States Navy confirmed the discovery.


The Lost 52 Project, named after the number of U.S. Navy submarines sunk during World War II, has previously located several of those vessels — three or four by varying reports — using data released by the U.S. Navy.  However, the information provided concerning the Grayback contained a mistranslation, placing its probable location according to the New York Times about 100 miles from Okinawa, to the east-southeast.


Amateur researcher and systems engineer Yutaka Iwasaki of Kobe, Japan came across military records that showed a Japanese bomber had attacked a U.S. vessel in late February, but the coordinates it gave differed from the Navy's figures for the Grayback by one digit.  Lost 52 sailed to the alternative probable location and deployed underwater drones to search the ocean floor using sonar.


The trip was subject to technical problems requiring a return to shore to fix broken equipment.  One of the drones began to malfunction, but it was able to send back the data it had collected, which revealed a mass at a depth below 1400 feet.  The team subsequently deployed a camera, providing footage of the name plaque on the side of the vessel with the name ""Grayback"" still legible.  


Team leader Tim Taylor told the Washington Post, ""It was amazing. Everyone was excited [...] Then you realize there are 80 men buried there, and it's a sobering experience.""


The Tambor-class submarine U.S.S. Grayback encountered a Japanese Nakajima b5N carrier bomber while returning from its tenth patrol in late February 1944. The Grayback was short on torpedoes from its recent attack on Japanese cargo ships. The Lost 52 Project identifies February 26, 1944 as the day it sank.

In findings published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE, an international team of scientists report ancient Egyptians captured sacred ibises (Threskiornis aethiopicus) from the wild for use in ritual sacrifice rather than domesticating the birds.


Millions of mummified ibis birds have been found in Egyptian tombs and catacombs in Saqqara and Tuna el-Gebel, and Egyptologists have reported they were sacrificed to the god Thoth, who is often depicted with the head of an ibis, the way Horus is shown with the head of a falcon and Bast with the head of a cat.


Lead author Sally Wasef of Australia's Griffith University explained to the press, ""The ibis was considered [to represent] the god Thoth, the god of wisdom, the god of magic, the god of judgment, writing all sorts of things [...] If you had a boss that annoys you and you don't feel like you are getting a good judgment from him or you want fairness and justice, you go and ask Thoth to interfere and in return you promise to offer him an ibis, a mummified ibis, in his annual feast.""


Some scholars have suggested Egyptians raised or farmed the birds to make them available in the necessary numbers.  While some ancient Egyptian writers made passing mention of feeding bread and plants to ibises, according to Wasef archaeologists have not yet turned up any hatchery structures.


The team collected DNA samples from mummified birds collected from six separate catacombs including sites at Abydos, Saqqara, and Tuna el-Gebel with permission from the Egyptian Ministry of State for Antiquity, and several museums offered to send tissue samples from the mummified ibises in their collections.  They were able to extract complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from fourteen.  These they compared to those of 26 modern ibises from different parts of Africa — ibises of this species disappeared from Egypt itself during modern times.  They found the DNA sequences from the ancient birds to be relatively diverse.  If the birds had been domesticated or even heavily farmed, they reasoned, the Egyptian specimens would have shown only a little genetic diversity.


Wasif suggested, in likelihood, ""next to each temple there was like a lake or a wetland — it is a natural habitat for the ibis to live in and if you are giving them food they will keep coming[.]""


According to the researchers, sacrifice and mummification of sacred ibises was common in Egypt from about 664 b.c.e. to 250 c.e., from the twenty-sixth dynasty into the early period of Roman Egypt.

In findings published on Monday in Nature Sustainability, researchers mostly from Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in the U.S. reported the invention of a new coating that could reduce bacterial growth, water waste, and odor when sprayed onto an ordinary house toilet by rendering its surface too slippery for anything to remain attached for long.


According to the research team, half of all people worldwide are affected by limits on their water supply, while daily fresh water usage to flush the planet's roughly 1 billion toilets and flush urinals is upwards of 141 billion liters (about 37 billion U.S. gallons, 31 billion imperial gallons); which they note is several times larger than the total rate of water consumption for the continent of Africa. Inventions that render the facilities more water-efficient, they reason, could have a profound impact on wastewater management, sustainable water use, and sanitation, possibly cutting the amount of water used to flush waste by, reportedly, a factor of two.


""Our team"" study co-author Tak-Sing Wong said in a press release ""has developed a robust bio-inspired, liquid, sludge-, and bacteria-repellent coating that can essentially make a toilet self-cleaning[.]"" Wong is Penn State's Wormley Early Career Professor of Engineering and an associate professor of mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering.


Co-developer Jing Wang recounted, ""When we put that coating on a toilet in the lab and dump synthetic fecal matter on it, [the synthetic fecal matter] just completely slides down and nothing sticks to [the coated surface.]""


The more something sticks to a surface, the more water it takes to rinse it off. The researchers reported inventing a coating good at resisting substances that are sticky and vary profoundly in viscosity across their mass—like human fecal matter. They also reported the coating repels bacteria, which has implications for preventing the spread of disease and certainly reduces smells.


The invention, called a liquid-entrenched smooth surface (LESS) coating, involves two separate treatments, both presented as suitable for spraying onto ceramics amongst other materials. The first spray is made of molecularly grafted polymers, specifically polydimethylsiloxane silicone, that Wang described as resembling human hairs — though vastly thinner — once it has dried on the target surface, which makes the surface very smooth. The second spray covers the target surface in silicone lubricant. According to the report, the two-spray process is complete in under five minutes and lasts for roughly 500 flushes before requiring reapplication. Existing treatments have tended to take hours to set.


Carl Hensman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which offered a contest for redesigning the toilet some years ago, noted the ingredients in the sprays are also found in commonly used products like — in the case of the first spray — toothpaste, and are unlikely to pollute nearby water supplies; though he also remarked that, because the spray wears off, it was unlikely to be used widely in developing countries as the researchers claim to hope.


Wong and three of his co-authors have started a company, spotLESS Materials, to transform their invention into a product. He remarked, ""As a researcher in an academic setting, my goal is to invent things that everyone can benefit from [...] As a Penn Stater, I see this culture being amplified through entrepreneurship, and I'm excited to contribute."" They have received support from the Rice Business Plan Competition, Ben Franklin Technology Partners' TechCelerator, Y-Combinator, and the United States' National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and Office of Naval Research.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Researchers_break_down_deaths_due_to_power_plant_pollution_in_the_United_States,2019-11-23,Researchers break down deaths due to power plant pollution in the United States,"Saturday, November 23, 2019 


In findings published Wednesday in Environmental Science and Technology, researchers from the University of Washington and Stanford University reported that premature deaths in the United States attributable to the pollution produced by power plants were disproportionately caused by coal; that race was a significant factor in who was affected; and that a substantial fraction of the deaths were from pollution crossing state lines.


The study focused on particulate matter, or PM2.5, specifically airborne particles under 2.5 micrometers in diameter. To track the movement of these particles across the United States, the research team established a reduced-complexity model, which can complete analyses faster than traditional models, so the team's study could encompass nearly all the United States' power plants.


Particulate matter in the air, like that produced at power plants, can cause lung problems, heart attacks and stroke, which then lead to premature death. In the United States alone, particulate matter is indirectly responsible for reportedly upwards of 100,000 deaths annually.


According to the study, in 2014 in the continental United States, roughly 16,000 premature deaths were attributable to power plants, an estimated 91% of those from coal. The researchers also found in 36 states most of the people who died were affected by pollution generated in another state. For example, 37% of the power plant pollution that reaches Ohio comes from plants in nearby Indiana.


The study's lead author, doctoral candidate Maninder Thind, said, ""We looked at emissions from different types of power plants — including coal, natural gas, diesel and oil power plants — and modeled how the pollutants would travel based on things like wind patterns or rain. We also consider how emissions can react in the atmosphere to form fine particle air pollution [...] That gave us a map of pollution concentrations across the country. Then we overlaid that map with data from the census to get an estimate of where people live and how this pollution results in health impacts.""


Even after the researchers adjusted their data for economic factors, premature deaths from this type of pollution were stratified by race, with the highest likelihood for black Americans, at a rate of seven per 100,000 people. They were followed by non-Latino white Americans at six per 100,000; for all other racial groups in the country, there were only four premature deaths per 100,000. Income did affect people's level of exposure but to a far less pronounced extent, a difference of one per 100,000 between annual incomes below US$10,000 versus above $200,000.


Another co-author, civil and environmental engineering professor Julian Marshall, said, ""We've seen in our previous research that our society is more segregated by race than by income, and now it's showing up again with air pollution from electricity generation emissions [...] These results can help local, state or national governments make more informed decisions that will improve everyone's air quality and quality of life."" 


Marshall noted, ""It's especially relevant these days because of what the federal government is doing — or actually not doing — around air pollution and around these issues in general[.]""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Hundreds_of_Hong_Kong_district_council_seats_go_to_pro-democracy_candidates,2019-11-27,Hundreds of Hong Kong district council seats go to pro-democracy candidates,"Wednesday, November 27, 2019 


On Sunday, Hong Kongers turned out more than 2.9 million strong to vote in their district-level elections.  Over 80% of the 452 available  district council seats went to pro-democracy candidates, often ousting pro-Beijing candidates, giving them control of 17 out of 18 of the area's districts.


The district council is the only level of Hong Kong government that is, as news sources noted, completely democratic, and the councilors make up about a tenth part of the body that elects the chief executive of Hong Kong.  Most councilors' duties involve action at the neighborhood level, like maintaining parks, arranging trash collection, and dealing with pests, which in at least one case involved wild boars.


Although Hong Kong's district elections are, reportedly, usually quiet, this year not even one district council candidate ran unopposed.  The turnout was about 71%, some 25% higher than last year.


Voter Kitty Mak told The Atlantic, ""Today we are trying to do the best we can for Hong Kong right now. Every little step matters [...] It is a protest vote against an authoritarian government; we cannot tolerate this government's policies anymore.""


Chinese University political scientist Ma Ngok said the turnout was seen as public support of the protesters who have demonstrated in Hong Kong since June. He noted, ""The government and the pro-Beijing camp have always claimed they have public support [...] But now [...] this is a big slap in the face because the public has showed their real position in record numbers.""


The city has been home to intense, occasionally violent pro-democracy protests since June of this year, some of which have shut down parts of the city.  The protests began after the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to a law to allow the government of mainland China to extradite anyone accused of a crime to the mainland to be prosecuted under the Chinese judicial system, but the motivation behind the events have expanded to include demands for investigations into police brutality and a more representative form of democracy within Hong Kong government.


About 2.9 million people voted in Sunday's election.  The total population of Hong Kong is about 7.5 million.

On Friday, 28-year-old Usman Khan stabbed reportedly several people at Fishmongers' Hall in London with a large knife, then fled up London Bridge. Members of the public confronted him; one man sprayed Khan with a fire extinguisher, others struck him with their fists and took his knife, and another, a Polish chef named Łukasz, harried him with a five-foot narwhal tusk. Khan was pinned to the ground. Police arrived and shot him dead. By reports on Saturday, two of Khan's victims died, and three others were seriously injured.


According to police, they received the first call about the attack at Fishmongers' Hall around 2:00 p.m. local time. Khan reportedly started attacking people there, and one of them died inside of the hall, according to The Times. Police reported the attacker exited the Hall and continued to attack others.


At the London Bridge, members of the public stopped Khan. According to videos posted on social media, people approached Khan armed with the fire extinguisher and the narwhal tusk and forced him to lie on the ground, after which a third person removed his knife. According to these videos and NPR, the police then surrounded the attacker aiming at him with their guns, moved a last bystander out of the way, and shot Khan.


The University of Cambridge had been hosting a program about criminal rehabilitation at Fishmongers' Hall called ""Learning Together"". According to a Twitter post by Amy Cook, director of the Learning Together event, the five-foot (one and two thirds meters) marine mammal tusk came from the wall in Fishmongers' Hall. Łukasz, who reportedly works at Fishmongers' Hall as a chef, having thus armed himself, participated in the chase and sustained a stabbing injury to his hand before the police arrived. Broadcaster Piers Morgan commented, ""The guy with the whale tusk is a Polish chef named Luckasz. Worth noting this for the next time someone says, 'we've let too many Eastern Europeans into this country'.""


Police also said Khan had appeared to be wearing a suicide vest, though it was later found to be a harmless fake.


One of the men who held Khan down was James Ford, 42, a convicted murderer approaching the end of his sentence at an open prison.  Another was tour manager Thomas Gray, 24, who cited only his experience with the sport of rugby: ""'one in, all in'. I did what any Londoner would do and tried to put a stop to it.""


""I am in awe of the people who ran towards danger to keep us all safe"" tweeted Mayor of London Sadiq Khan (no relation). ""The bravery of the emergency services and ordinary Londoners is incredible.""


Khan was convicted of terrorism years ago for his participation in a London Stock Exchange bomb plan and served eight years of a sixteen-year sentence. He was released in 2018 and has been out on license, also called parole, and living in Staffordshire.


Lucy Fischer of The Times told NPR, ""[Khan] had been released a year ago on the provision that he had agreed to wear an electronic tag, submit to curfews and restrictions to his movements"".


""In the US there is a phenomenon 'suicide by cop'"", Birmingham City University criminology professor David Wilson told the press. ""[I]ncreasingly what we are seeing is some attackers wear pretend suicide vests as they prefer martyrdom than getting a sentence. I wonder if what we are seeing is another version of suicide by cop.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Samoan_government_temporarily_shuts_down_for_nationwide_measles_vaccination_drive,2019-12-07,Samoan government temporarily shuts down for nationwide measles vaccination drive,"Saturday, December 7, 2019 


On Thursday local time, the government of Samoa began a planned two-day shutdown to make way for a nationwide vaccination campaign to combat the measles outbreak that had, by reports, infected over 4,200 of the island nation's roughly 200,0000 residents since October and killed at least 62, including, according to government reports, 54 small children. Residents were told to stay off the roads and businesses and ferries were closed to make way for vaccination teams.


Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi noted on Monday, the fatalities were all unvaccinated.


The only civil servants not assigned to assist in the vaccination effort were those working on water and electricity.


In remarks to the Agence France-Presse news service, Sheldon Yett of UNICEF observed, ""I've seen mass mobilisation campaigns before, but not over an entire country like this[.]""


Households with at least one unvaccinated person were asked to place a red flag somewhere visible. This included the home of Prime Minister Tuilaepa, who told the press his nephew needed a dose. 


The vaccination drive itself started November 20. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccination before the outbreak began covered only about 31 percent of Samoans. Al Jazeera reported on Thursday, coverage had risen to 55 percent. According to Yett, the goal for the two-day shut down was to exceed 90 percent.


Earlier this week, an official government Twitter account made the following announcement: ""Latest update: 3,728 measles cases have been reported since the outbreak with 198 recorded in the last 24 hours. To date, 53 measles related deaths have been recorded. Since the Mass Vaccination Campaign on 20 Nov 2019, the Ministry has successfully vaccinated 58,150 individuals."" Since then, the government has reported more cases of measles, including 165 in the single day before the shutdown began.


When announcing the shutdown on Monday, Prime Minister Tuilaepa called on ""village councils, faith-based organizations, and church leaders, village mayors and government women representatives"" to instill confidence in vaccines in the public.


Samoan vaccination rates dropped in 2018 after two small children died from a faulty vaccine. According to Samoa Observer editor Keni Lesa, the anti-vaccine movement was able to tap into the resulting public mistrust and ""really hammer home their message.""


The Samoan government declared a state of emergency on November 15, shut down all schools as of November 17, and later banned children from public gatherings in an effort to curb the spread of the disease.


According to the WHO, the number of cases of measles globally in the first half of this year exceeded those of any other whole year since 2006. Various countries, including the United States, have seen marked increases in measles cases in recent years.


Measles affects the respiratory system. It often involves rashes and fever but it can be much more serious. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, one out of every thousand children who contract measles develop encephalitis, which can cause deafness or brain damage.


Measles is one of several diseases that drastically reduced the indigenous population of Pacific island nations and the Americas after first contact with Europeans. The first measles vaccine was introduced in the 1960s, and the incidence dropped, in some cases to almost zero, in parts of the world in which its use became widespread. It has since seen a resurgence partly due to vaccine hesitancy and vaccine inaccessibility.

On Wednesday, Time magazine announced its selection of climate change activist Greta Thunberg as their 2019 ""Person of the Year"". The sixteen-year-old Swede is currently the youngest recipient of the 92-year-old award. Thunberg received the award, with which Time credits an individual as having done ""for better or for worse [...] the most to influence the events of the year"", for her work drawing attention to the issue of climate change.


Thunberg began her climate protest on August 20, 2018, at the age of fifteen, outside of the Swedish Parliament, instead of attending school. She protested alone on the first day, but thousands of Swedes eventually joined the protest. That September, the Fridays for Future movement launched; Thunberg promised protests every week until Sweden joined the Paris Agreement. Other countries had similar protests, with 35 thousand students protesting in Belgium in January of this year.


Thunberg then led, according to Time, the largest climate change demonstration ever held to date, on September 20 of this year. An estimated four million people overall took part in the protests. This included marches of 250 thousand protesters in New York City, 100 thousand in London, and 1.4 million in cities throughout Germany. Time reported some were using the slogan ""Make the World Greta Again"".


In her campaign, Thunberg has met with multiple world leaders advocating climate change action, including giving an address at the United Nations, meeting with Roman Catholic Pope Francis, and speaking to the United States Congress. Her influence also resulted in a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. 


According to NBC, Time also considered the United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, United States President Donald Trump, protesters in Hong Kong over Chinese extradition, and a United States whistleblower who revealed an alleged illicit interaction between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

██ Conservative Party - 365 seats

██ Labour Party - 203 seats

██ Scottish National Party - 48 seats

██ Liberal Democrats - 11 seats

██ Democratic Unionist Party - 8 seats

██ Sinn Féin - 7 seats

██ Plaid Cymru - 4 seats

██ Green Party (E & W) - 1 seat

██ Alliance Party of Northern Ireland - 1 seat

On Thursday, the United Kingdom's (UK) Conservative Party netted an additional 66 seats, totaling 365 seats, surpassing the 326 seats needed for a majority in Parliament.  Results and reaction came in early on Friday.  Before this election, the Conservative Party was the largest party, but had just 318 seats, which is not a majority.


Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""humbled"" by the results and ""...I and we will never take your support for granted. And I will make it my mission to work night and day, flat out, to prove you right in voting for me this time and to earn your support in the future."" Election implications regarding the UK's efforts on leaving the European Union (EU) were described by Johnson as a ""historic mandate"", saying he intends to leave the EU by the end of January.


The conservative party gained 66 seats since Parliament was last in session, while the second largest party, Labour, lost 42. The Scottish National Party (SNP) gained 13 seats and Liberal Democrats lost 10. There were no Change UK candidates elected, which lost all 5 of its seats. The Brexit Party failed to obtain any seats.


The Labour Party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn announced he will not seek the party's leadership position in the next general election cycle. Liberal Democrats are to find a new leader after Jo Swinson was defeated in Dunbartonshire East by an SNP candidate with a 149 vote margin. The Blyth Valley seat has, since its creation in 1950, always elected a Labour Member of Parliament, but elected a conservative candidate in this election.


Voter turnout was down by about 1.5% of the electorate from the 2017 election cycle, with this time about 67.3%.

On Friday, United States District Judge Clark Waddoups reconsidered his decision made the previous day — that people born in American Samoa are United States citizens and not merely U.S. nationals. Instead, he put a stay on his ruling until the issue is resolved upon appeal. 


On Thursday, Waddoups wrote denying American Samoans citizenship violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which established the country's policy of citizenship for every person born on its soil. A 2015 federal court decision said citizenship in United States territories can only be resolved by Congress. 


American Samoans, unlike people born in the fifty states and all other U.S. possessions, such as Puerto Rico and Guam, do not automatically gain U.S. citizenship upon birth. Instead, they are called ""U.S. nationals"" on their passports. That means they may freely move to and live in any other U.S. territory or state, but once there may not vote in federal elections, serve on juries, work jobs that require citizenship or run for elected office. 


Three American Samoans, Pale Tuli, Rosavita Tuli, and John Fitisemanu, who had moved to Utah, a state, sued to be allowed to vote and apply for government jobs that require citizenship. Fitisemanu had lived in Utah for more than twenty years. They worked with the organization Equally American.


The government of American Samoa issued a statement agreeing the issue should be decided by Congress and not by judges: ""imposition of citizenship by judicial fiat would fail to recognize American Samoa's sovereignty and the importance of the fa'a Samoa [the Samoan way of life]."" Their statement also read ""imposition of citizenship over American Samoan's objections violates fundamental principles of self-determination.""


In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case about American Samoans' citizenship status.


The American Samoan delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives, Aumua Amata, told the press: ""Because the residents of American Samoa have vibrant democratic processes and already had a path to citizenship that I had worked to make even more accessible, the ruling is particularly unwelcome and inappropriate[.]""


American Samoa, not to be confused with the nearby independent country Samoa, is an unincorporated U.S. territory but not a state. American Samoa has a delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives but no congressional representative or senator, so American Samoans' ability to affect federal legislation is limited.


For an American Samoan, applying for naturalized status costs $725, not counting lawyers' fees.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/US_House_of_Representatives_impeaches_President_Trump,2019-12-21,US House of Representatives impeaches President Trump,"Saturday, December 21, 2019 


On Wednesday, the United States House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump over complaints arising from an alleged abuse of power. Trump, the third President to be impeached by the House, is to face trial in the Senate.


The House passed two different articles of impeachment. The first charged Trump with abuse of power, and the second accused him of obstruction of Congress. The abuse of power charge stemmed from allegations Trump tried to pressure the Ukrainian government to launch an investigation of Joe Biden's son, in order to help Trump's chances in the 2020 United States presidential election in which Biden is also running. The articles passed by votes of 230-to-197 and 229-to-198 respectively.


The impeachment occurred largely along partisan lines, with Democratic members of the House voting in favor of the impeachment, and Republican members opposing. Two Democratic Representatives, Collin Peterson and Jeff Van Drew, opposed both articles of impeachment, and a third, Jared Golden, voted for the first article but against the second. In the immediate aftermath of the vote, CNN reported Jeff Van Drew was expected to leave the Democratic party.


Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate Majority Leader, reportedly previously committed to proceeding with an impeachment trial, anticipated to begin in January. He publicly stated the trial would not be impartial, saying he anticipated having ""a largely partisan outcome"" in the Senate. Republicans hold a majority in the Senate, and for a trial to result in removal from office a two-thirds majority is needed. If Trump were removed, the Senate constitutionally could disqualify him from serving as President again.


The House has only impeached two other Presidents. Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868. The Senate acquitted both of them.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Typhoon_Phanfone_strikes_Philippines,2019-12-28,Typhoon Phanfone strikes Philippines,"Saturday, December 28, 2019 


Typhoon Phanfone made landfall on the central Philippines from Tuesday night through to Wednesday, killing at least 20 according to Philippine officials on Thursday, and leaving reportedly at least 15,000 stranded at ports. 


Phanfone impacted upon popular tourist attractions, such as Boracay and Coron, as well as the Kalibo International Airport. It also blocked roads and forced over 58,000 civilians to evacuate.


Phanfone damaged similar regions to Typhoon Haiyan, which killed over 6,000 people in 2013. Cindy Ferrer, head of a regional civil defense office, said ""[Typhoon Phanfone is] like the younger sibling of Haiyan. It’s less destructive, but it followed a similar path"". Philippine Red Cross chair Richard Gordon, in remarks to the BBC, said ""A lot of people have lost their homes and they need food"". He also said many areas lost water and power, and might not get them back for weeks.


Typhoon Phanfone continued westward on Thursday, toward the South China Sea and Asia.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Radio_host_Don_Imus_dies_aged_79,2019-12-30,Radio host Don Imus dies aged 79,"Monday, December 30, 2019 


United States radio personality, television host, and philanthropist Don Imus, known to fans as the I-Man, died on Friday at the Baylor Scott and White Medical Center in College Station, Texas after being hospitalized since Christmas Eve, his family reported. Associated Press reported his cause of death as complications from lung disease. He was 79.


Imus' syndicated radio show Imus in the Morning aired on various networks from 1968 until his retirement in 2018. The show was simulcast on MSNBC television from 1996 until a racial incident in 2007 and for several years up to 2015 on the Fox Business Network. He was once named one of Time's 25 most influential Americans, and was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.


Known as a shock jock who made controversial comments, Imus was dropped in 2007 by MSNBC and CBS Radio after he referred to the Rutgers University women's basketball team as ""nappy headed hos."" He later apologized for the comment.


Imus is survived by his second wife Dierdre Coleman, their two sons Wyatt and Zachary, and four daughters, Nadine, Ashley, Elizabeth, and Toni, from his previous marriage.


The family's statement on the death read: ""Don loved and adored Deirdre, who unconditionally loved him back, loved spending his time watching Wyatt become a highly skilled, champion rodeo rider and calf roper and loved and supported Zachary (Cates), who first met the Imus family at age 10 when he participated in the Imus Ranch program for kids with cancer, having battled and overcome leukemia, eventually becoming a member of the Imus family and Don and Deirdre's second son"".


Longtime Imus in the Morning writer and performer Rob Bartlett tweeted: ""He was a rebel, an unapologetic decrier of bullshit, a harsh critic of human behavior & yet an unfailing champion of the underdog, especially sick children. A hermit and humanitarian. Brilliant and maddening & someone you loved to hate and hated to love but when you told him you did he’d say you were a phony. Every professional success I’ve enjoyed is a direct result of my association with the I-Man. I‘m beyond grateful to him for being my boss, my mentor, & my friend. My heart breaks for Deirdre, Wyatt & Zach. Rest easy Cowboy. You’ve earned it.""


The account for The Bernie and Sid Show, which replaced Imus in the Morning, hosted by Bernard McGuirk and Sid Rosenberg, who both worked for Imus, tweeted: ""I-Man. We salute you. You paved the way for us and many more. A radio legend indeed. RIP #Imus"".


As of today, former coworker and long time rival shock jock Howard Stern, with whom Imus feuded, has not commented on the death on his Twitter account. However, earlier this year, Stern said in an interview with Rolling Stone he was open to having Imus as a guest on his show.


The family said they planned to have a private funeral service for Imus and asked for donations to the Imus Ranch Foundation, which provides support for families with children suffering from serious diseases.
