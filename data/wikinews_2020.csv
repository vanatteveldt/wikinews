https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Samoan_government_ends_state_of_emergency_over_measles_outbreak,2020-01-01,Samoan government ends state of emergency over measles outbreak,"On Sunday, the state of emergency begun on November 15 over a measles outbreak ended in Samoa. The island nation's cabinet unanimously voted to lift it on Saturday afternoon, and the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) announced the decision that night. NEOC reported a 95% immunization rate on December 24, and the last measles-related death during the state of emergency on December 26. 


Restrictions on public gathering and travel were to be lifted, and schools to reopen.  The Health Emergency Operation Center were to take over the relief efforts centralized under the National Emergency Operation Centre. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were tasked to produce a recovery plan within two weeks for consideration by the cabinet. 


As of Sunday, the Disease Surveillance Team reported a total of 5667 cases during the outbreak. Out these, 1846 persons were hospitalized and 1720 had already been discharged, while 81 had lost their lives.  The December 6 National Measles Response and Recovery Appeal identified children under 5 years of age as having the highest mortality, corresponding with the relative shortfall of vaccination in the age group. 


Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital returned to normal operation on Sunday, joining Faleolo District Hospital and Leulumoega District Hospital, which returned to normal on Friday. During the peak of the outbreak, Tupua Tamasese Meaole's Acute Primary Care Clinic and Leulumoega District hospital were made measles wards, and Leulumoega District Hospital was designated to deal with patients without measles, in an effort to quarantine infected individuals. The Australian medical mission's fifth rotation is to remain on the islands until January 4 to help facilitate the transition. On Sunday teams had already begun to disassemble the tents erected to deal with the large number of admissions. 


The state of emergency was expected to end on December 15, but on December 14 it was extended by two weeks to allow the immunization campaign to continue. At the time, the prime minister called for a 100% immunization rate, and stated 92% had been reached.  As of Sunday, the rate had reached 95% according to NEOC data. Aid agencies say populations with sufficiently high vaccination rates have enough herd immunity to prevent any further infections from spreading out of control, meaning an infected person is not likely to come into contact with enough unvaccinated people to cause a chain reaction.


UNICEF reported they had delivered over 105 thousand doses of vaccine to Samoa by November 22. The national vaccination campaign started on November 20.  A government order made vaccination mandatory and free of charge for children between six months and 19 years of age and for women between 20 and 35, considered childbearing age. On December 5 and 6, the government of Samoa executed a planned shutdown of public services and the private sector to leave room for a nationwide door-to-door immunization drive. The government said 128 vaccination teams participated. 


To curb the spread of disease, the government prohibited inter-island travel for those under 19, schools were closed, and authorities recommended residents avoid public gatherings and medical facilities unless they were in need of medical attention. Unvaccinated pregnant women were prohibited from going to their workplaces. 


The outbreak was first confirmed by the government on October 16, after the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne tested 7 out of 20 suspected cases positive for measles. 


In 2019 in the Pacific region, outbreaks of measles were declared in parts of the Philippines first on February 6, Tonga on October 22, Fiji on November 7, and American Samoa on December 8.  The D8 strain, which caused a New Zealand outbreak, has been identified in Samoa and Fiji.  New Zealand serves as a travel hub for small Pacific nations.  According to data from the World Health Organisation, in 2018 there were approximately 10 million cases of measles and 140 thousand related deaths worldwide.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/United_States_military_kills_Qasem_Soleimani,2020-01-05,United States military kills Qasem Soleimani,"Thursday, United States military forces killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran's Quds Force, in an airstrike. The United States called its actions defensive in nature, pointing to the December 31 attack on the United States Embassy in Baghdad as an example of the attacks on U.S. citizens that Soleimani took part in.


The United States carried out the airstrike at Baghdad International Airport, where Soleimani was arriving by plane. He was being met by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was also killed in the airstrike. al-Muhandis was the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an Iranian-backed militia. Other victims included a Kataeb Hezbollah official and Mohammed Reda, an airport protocol officer. The Daily Telegraph, citing local paramilitary groups, reported that the attack consisted of three rockets launched from helicopters.


In a statement released after the attack, the United States Department of Defense justified the strike, which was approved by President Donald Trump, as ""defensive"" in nature: ""At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more. He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months – including the attack on December 27th – culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel. General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week. This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.""


The military strike follows rocket attacks on the United States Embassy in Iraq; Business Insider reported that the rocket strikes were carried out by sympathizers of the PMF. In a statement following the attack, Ahmed al-Assadi, a spokesman for the PMF, blamed both Israel and the United States for the attack. As of January 3, no evidence of Israeli involvement has been reported.


The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which includes the Quds Force, declared that Soleimani was ""martyred"" by the airstrike. Sayyid Ali Hosseini Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, ordered three days of public mourning after the strike. In his message, he appreciated Soleimani's lifepath: ""He was a stellar example of those educated and nurtured in Islam and the school of Imam Khomeini (ra). He spent his entire life engaging in jihad in the path of God. Martyrdom was his reward for years of implacable efforts [...] Shahid Soleymani is the international face of the resistance and all who have a heart-felt connection to the resistance seek his blood revenge.""


In his statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu found the air strike justified and called Trump's order swift, forceful and decisive.


The United States Embassy in Iraq had suspended operations, and advised U.S. citizens to leave the country immediately in its January 3 security alert. The office asked U.S. citizens not approach the Embassy, and if in need for travel documents, to use the consulate in Erbil.


Adil Abdul-Mahdi, the acting Prime Minister of Iraq, spoke out against the attack, calling it ""an aggression on Iraq as a state, government and people"" as well as a violation of the rules relating to the presence of United States troops in Iraq.


In 2007, the United States government labeled Soleimani as a terrorist and levied sanctions against him. He was further sanctioned in 2011 in relation to a plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. Last April, the United States Department of State also designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization. The United States had also levied individual sanctions against al-Muhandis.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Iraqi_Parliament_votes_for_expulsion_of_United_States_troops,2020-01-06,Iraqi Parliament votes for expulsion of United States troops,"Yesterday, the Parliament of Iraq voted on a resolution to expel United States troops from the country. The move follows the United States' killing of Qasem Soleimani in an airstrike last week.


The vote, which is not binding, was boycotted by both Kurdish and Sunni Members of Parliament. The resolution still awaited approval by the Iraqi government. NPR reported Adil Abdul-Mahdi, the caretaker Prime Minister, recommended the United States troops in Iraq withdraw.


The United States had not, as of yesterday, announced any plans to remove the troops, which are there with an international coalition to counter the Islamic State (ISIS). Following the vote, a United States Department of State spokesperson, Morgan Ortagus, indicated the United States was disappointed by the Parliament's decision: ""While we await further clarification on the legal nature and impact of today's resolution,"" he said, ""we strongly urge Iraqi leaders to reconsider the importance of the ongoing economic and security relationship between the two countries and the continued presence of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS"".


The coalition came to Iraq to fight ISIS after the group took over about a third of the country. The Iraqi government has since declared victory, but the U.S. troops have remained in Iraq to prevent ISIS from gaining ground again.


The strike took place in Iraq, at Baghdad International Airport. The Foreign Ministry of Iraq characterized the attack as ""a serious violation of Iraqi sovereignty"".

The stampede, which occurred in Kerman, resulted in at least 56 deaths and over 200 people injured, according to state television. Attendance at the procession in Kerman, Soleimani's hometown, was by varying reports tens or hundreds of thousands.  It was to have been the last of several funeral processions for Soleimani.


More than a million people attended an earlier funeral procession, which took place in Tehran on Monday.


Soleimani was head of Iran's Quds Force. He was killed last week by a United States military airstrike in Iraq.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Fire_erupts_in_parking_structure_at_Sola_Airport,_Norway",2020-01-10,"Fire erupts in parking structure at Sola Airport, Norway","At about 15:30 local time (1430 UTC) on Tuesday a fire was reported in the ""Kiss & Fly"" section of a parking structure at Stavanger Airport, Sola in Norway. The structure has over 3000 parking spaces; reports said more than half of those were filled. The airport was quickly closed to air traffic.


It was initially reported the fire started in an electric vehicle, but news broadcaster NRK later reported the fire started in a recalled 2005 Opel Zafira. The car was recalled after a similar fire in Cork, Ireland in August last year, causing damage to about 60 cars. Police said they questioned the car's owner.


The fire produced heavy smoke, and local officials said there was danger the building might collapse. Nils-Erik Haagenrud of Rogaland Fire and Rescue said late on Tuesday no personnel would be sent into the building. Rogaland Fire and Rescue requested support and equipment from other fire departments. The airport and nearby hotel were both evacuated and local police warned people in the general vicinity to stay inside and close exterior vents and windows. Through Tuesday evening the fire was reduced and the order for a fire extinguisher robot from Oslo Fire and Rescue was canceled. 


The airport closure also led to Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg being stranded after a visit to the Johan Sverdrup oil field. Solberg posted on Twitter asking for places to eat for the seven hour drive from Stavanger to the capital of Oslo.


Reports as of Wednesday said an estimated two to three hundred vehicles had been damaged or destroyed, but no humans had been hurt.


By about 22:00 local time (2100 UTC) on Tuesday the flames were under control. Local firefighters planned to continue to monitor the situation and work to prevent further damage. It was also discovered the structure was built without sprinklers. Stavanger Airport, Sola was to open on Wednesday morning, but returning to normal service was expected to take longer. Affected travelers were advised to contact their airlines for rebooking.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Greek_prime_minister_reaffirms_EastMed_pipeline_project_is_open_for_other_countries_to_join,2020-01-10,Greek prime minister reaffirms EastMed pipeline project is open for other countries to join,"On Tuesday, the Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis reasserted the openness of the EastMed project, which is aimed at connecting the Eastern Mediterranean gas fields with the European mainland via a pipeline through contested waters.


In his Tuesday live-streamed talk at the United States think tank Atlantic Council's Washington headquarters, Mitsotakis reaffirmed that the EastMed project, which currently involves Greece, Cyprus and Israel, is open for other countries to join. ""We don't seek to exclude anyone from energy cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean provided they respect international law"", he said, repeating his January 2 remarks made on the EastMed signing ceremony.


He also commented on the Turkish-Libyan maritime border agreement, calling it ""null and void"" and ""geographically ridiculous"". ""The agreement assumes that our islands, including our biggest island Crete, does not have an exclusive economic zone, which goes against everything we know in international law"", he added. He also noted that the Libyan House of Representatives rejected the demarcation, and that Greece and Turkey might end up before International Court of Justice in the Hague if talks would fail. Mitsotakis underlined they keep channels to Turkey open for dialog and that he would be ""very-very happy if Turkey were to reconsider its overall approach"".


Later on Tuesday Mitsotakis met with the International Monetary Fund, then with President Trump, where he denounced the border agreement again. In regard of clashing exclusive economic zone claims, he noted ""it is important to point out that the agreement signed between Turkey and Libya infringe upon Greece’s sovereign rights"". 


On last Thursday, the delegations of Cyprus, Greece and Israel had met for their seventh trilateral summit, that time in Athens at the Zappeion Hall, to sign an agreement to construct the EastMed pipeline by 2025. The meeting was attended by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and energy minister Yuval Steinitz, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and energy minister Konstantinos Hatzidakis, and Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades and energy minister Georgios Lakkotrypis. The agreement was signed by the energy ministers.  Greek daily Kathimerini said Greece and Cyprus had to speed up to counter possible Turkish interference with the project.


Earlier that day, the Greek gas producer Energean signed a letter of intent on selling two billion cubic meters of gas per year to the Greek gas supplier DEPA. The planned pipeline capacity is 10 billion cubic meters per year. Energean has committed 1.7 billion dollars in the Karish and Tanin fields.


With this forming of political and economic alliance with Hellenic countries, Netanyahu envisioned the pipeline to end their ""fringe country"" status. Netanyahu called on Italy and Egypt to join the project, adding ""We call on any other country that wishes to join us to do so"". In Cyprus, the ruling Democratic Rally in Cyprus hailed the pipeline as an advancement in the nation's sovereignty. Progressive Party of Working People, the main opposition force, underlined that the agreement is only a legal framework, and actual construction is in the hands of still undecided private investors. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy underlined Turkish and Turkish Cypriot mining rights in the region, and projected a failure if these would be overlooked. 


Otranto, Italy is a proposed end point for the pipeline, and Italian economic development minister Stefano Patuanelli sent a letter of support prior to the signing, but the minister said they are to build another pipeline to Igoumenitsa, Greece. The United States expressed its support via the December 20 signing of the Eastern Mediterranean Bill, a July 25 quadrilateral meeting in Washington, and sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the trilateral meeting of EastMed countries on March 20 last year. The EU partially funded the feasibility studies, as it considers the EastMed pipeline to be a Project of Common Interest (PCI), ending the energy isolation of Crete and Cyprus, and diversifying the gas supply of Europe, when completed.


In December, a Turkish official said that the trans-Anatolian pipeline, which is already up and running, renders the EastMed building effort unnecessary, Cyprus Mail reported. On November 27, Turkey and Libya signed a maritime border agreement, according to which a section between Crete and Cyprus would cross the Turkish economic zone. Athens expelled the Libyan ambassador to Greece over this issue. Turkey maintains a position that only Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey, has the right to the exclusive economic zone around the island. Because of its drilling operations there, Turkey is already under EU sanctions, and was condemned in a joint statement by Egypt, Greece and Cyprus on October 8.


In 2017, a memorandum of understanding about the pipeline was signed between Cyprus, Greece and Israel.


According to the Cyprus Mail, the 2000 km long pipeline is to connect the fields with Crete, the Greek mainland, and would end in Otranto, Italy. The May 2019 map of gas routes by Gas Infrastructure Europe draws the pipeline between the Aphrodite gas field and Thesprotia, Greece, where it merges with the Poseidon line en route to Italy.


Alex Lagakos, deputy director of the Greek Energy Forum, said the project has a geopolitical significance rather than an economic one. He called it unlikely that the EU would finance the project, as it has committed itself to green energy. The estimated cost is six billion euros, but the saturation of the gas markets and competition from liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals are likely to keep private investors away, he noted. Egypt has two usable terminals in the Nile-Delta, in Damietta and Idku. On September 19, 2018, Cyprus and Egypt had signed an alternative deal to export Aphrodite gas through these ports via a new pipeline.


Haifa University geostrategy expert and former Israeli security official, Avinoam Idan, said the new EastMed supply can't be considered a significant geopolitical change to Europe's energy market, as it would not affect the market share of Russian gas. In the analysis of the German Institute for Economic Research, the high costs and technical challenges render the project unrealistic.


During the trilateral meeting of Cyprus, Greece and Israel on January 28, 2016, the then-envisioned EuroAsia Interconnector was considered as an alternative route to export the gas as electricity. The 1000 megawatt underwater cable connecting the three power grids is to be completed by December 2023. The estimated cost is 2.5 billion euros, and the EU considers it a PCI. EuroAfrica Interconnector, a similar project between Greece, Cyprus and Egypt, is also in its planning stage.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Cairo_summit_denounces_Turkish-Libyan_maritime_border_agreement,2020-01-11,Cairo summit denounces Turkish-Libyan maritime border agreement,"On Wednesday, an assembly of several foreign ministers in Cairo denounced the memoranda of understanding between Turkey and Libya in which Turkey and Libya agreed on maritime borders in the Eastern Mediterranean and allowed Turkish army deployments in Libya. The November border demarcation resulted in overlapping exclusive economic zone (EEZ) claims and would make the planned EastMed gas pipeline cross Turkish waters.


Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry and his Greek, Cypriot and French counterparts, Nikos Dendias, Nikos Christodoulides and Jean-Yves Le Drian, respectively, gathered in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss Libya–Turkey relations. The Italian foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, joined the talks as an observer.


They concluded that the November 27 maritime border agreement between Turkey and Libya is ""null and void"" and ""infringes upon the sovereign rights of third states, does not comply with the Law of the Sea and cannot produce any legal consequences"". They called on Turkey to halt their drilling operations within the EEZ of Cyprus, and deemed that the agreement on sending Turkish soldiers to Libya, where a civil war is underway, goes against the United Nations Security Council resolution 2259.


The foreign ministers agreed to a future meet on Crete.


In a related press release issued the following day, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the conclusions of the summit, calling the agreements ""legitimate and fully compatible with international law"". To resolve differences, they invited the countries to open dialogue, with the exception of Cyprus, which Turkey does not recognize.


On Wednesday during the opening ceremony of the TurkStream gas pipeline, Turkish president Erdoğan called for a regional cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean, claiming a right to Turkey to have a say in projects there, based on the country's long shoreline. ""No project excluding our country in the Eastern Mediterranean can be implemented with regard to economic, judicial and diplomatic aspects"", he said. He underlined the call for cooperation by saying ""we are ready to take more [positive] steps towards those taking a single step towards us."" He claimed the Turkish drilling on Cypriot waters is only to protect Turkish and Turkish Cypriot interests.


On Tuesday, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis speaking to the Atlantic Council think tank called the border agreement ""null and void"" and ""geographically ridiculous"". ""The agreement assumes that our islands, including our biggest island Crete, does not have an exclusive economic zone, which goes against everything we know in international law"", he added. He also noted that the Libyan House of Representatives did not ratify the demarcation, and mentioned a possible arbitration route at the International Court of Justice. The border issue is the ""main difference"" between Greece and Turkey, he added.


In the November 27 deal, Turkey and Libya agreed on a line as their shared maritime border that would make the sea between Crete and Cyprus a part of the Turkish EEZ. Turkey justified the claim based on their long shoreline and presented cases where islands played only a limited role when borders were drawn. Athens expelled the Libyan ambassador to Greece over the agreement.


The EastMed pipeline is a Israeli-Cypriot-Greek effort intended to connect East Mediterranean offshore gas fields with the European mainland via a pipeline, on a route which passes through Turkish-claimed maritime territories. Italy, the proposed end point, and Egypt, which have gas fields of its own, were openly called to join.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Sultan_Qaboos_of_Oman_dies,2020-01-12,Sultan Qaboos of Oman dies,"On Friday, Qaboos bin Said, the long-serving Sultan of Oman, died aged 79. He had recently had health problems, reportedly colon cancer. Tributes were paid by world leaders including the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.


The government of Oman announced three days of mourning. Before Qaboos's burial at a family cemetery, his successor, Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, attended funeral prayers at the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Muscat.


Qaboos became Sultan in 1970 after overthrowing his father, Sultan Said bin Taimur. By the time of his death, Qaboos's reign was the longest in the Arab world. He was known for pursuing a neutral foreign policy and mediating in several Middle Eastern disputes as a ""friend to all and enemy to none"". Most notably, he helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal that was signed in 2015.


Recently there had been growing concerns over his health. Following a week-long stay in a Belgian hospital, he returned to Oman in the middle of December, although there was no official information on what treatment he had received.


Qaboos was born 1940 and received his education in India and the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst in the United Kingdom, followed by a cultural tour of the world. Arriving back home in 1964, he turned to the study of Islamic law and Omani history.


Qaboos's 1970 overthrew of his father was a bloodless British-backed coup. He began a programme of reform which changed his poorly-developed country into a relatively prosperous nation.


Qaboos did not have children, so Omani law allowed three days for a royal council to select a successor. If they could not do so, the council and other leaders would open a sealed letter from Qaboos naming his preferred successor.


When the royal council met, they chose to open the letter and acknowledged Qaboos's cousin, Haitham, as the new Sultan. After the funeral, Haitham said he would continue Qaboos's policies including a neutral approach to foreign affairs.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said, ""The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake. My thoughts and prayers go to all the mourning families"".


A few hours before the Boeing 737-800 jet crashed on Wednesday, Iran launched missiles targeting US troops in Iraqi military bases in response to the US airstrike that killed Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani at a Baghdad airport.


US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the crash was ""likely"" Iran's doing. For several days Iran denied the accusation.


President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, ""We expect from Iran assurances of their readiness for a full and open investigation, bringing those responsible to justice, the return of the bodies of the dead, the payment of compensation, official apologies through diplomatic channels"".

Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has indicated the trial could possibly commence on Tuesday, January 21, subject to agreement on the procedures to be followed. McConnell has expressed a preference to proceed similarly to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1998.


Pelosi also mentioned the House will appoint as yet unnamed impeachment managers to conduct the prosecution in the trial. ""The American people deserve the truth, and the Constitution demands a trial."" Pelosi said. Additionally, the House must allocate money for the trial.


On December 18, the House passed two articles of impeachment. The first charged President Trump with abuse of power, and the second accused him of obstruction of Congress.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Seismic_activity_continues_to_shake_Puerto_Rico_with_5.2_quake,2020-01-17,Seismic activity continues to shake Puerto Rico with 5.2 quake,"On Wednesday morning, a magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit the already rattled United States commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico has experienced dozens of earthquakes over magnitude 4.5 since late December, including a 6.4 quake that hit on January 7 and caused an island-wide blackout.


The United States Geological Survey (USGS) placed the epicenter of the quake about eight kilometers (five miles) southwest of the town of Guenica.


One resident told Paul Rivera of WESH 2 news, ""We're used to it."" Seismologists have buried sensors in the ground in an attempt to find the cause of the past month's unusual seismic activity.


John Geiger of USGS told the press last week, ""The past several weeks we've had hundreds of small earthquakes in the same region [...] It began on Dec. 28, when we had a 4.7-magnitude [earthquake] there. Since the 4.7, we've had over 400 magnitude 2+ earthquakes.""


Last week, continuing aftershocks hampered repair efforts, and roughly two thirds of the island was still without power two days after the January 7 quake.  That event destroyed at least 300 homes, ripped up roads, killed one and injured eight people, and cracked the island's biggest power plant. The governor of Puerto Rico, Wanda Vázquez Garced, declared a state of emergency.


This followed a 5.8 magnitude earthquake the previous day that collapsed the famous Punta Ventana rock formation.


José Ortiz of the island's power authority said fixing the island's largest power plant, which was damaged by the quake, may take a year.  The Costa Sur power plant at Guayanilla was close to the January 7 quake's epicenter.  Costa Sur provided power for about a quarter of Puerto Rico's private homes and businesses.  Reportedly, without Costa Sur the island's other plants would have to operate near full capacity to keep the residents in power. 


Puerto Rico had still not fully recovered from 2017's Hurricane Maria, estimated to have done about $90 billion in property damage and claimed about 3000 lives.


In predictions since the January 7 quake, the U.S. Geological Survey has said the earthquakes may continue into early February.

The SARS-like virus first appeared in December in Wuhan, China. As of today, Chinese officials confirmed it has infected over 200 people mostly in Wuhan and killed three people. Reported cases also appeared in Thailand, South Korea, and Japan.


The study was conducted by Imperial College London's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis pursuant to a strange case of pneumonia in China. The study accounts for air traffic flow and known cases outside China to construe the estimate, a ""total of 1,723 cases"" in Wuhan on January 12.  The research team posted their findings online before official publication.


""It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported"", reads the report.


Chinese authorities have speculated the virus was transferred to humans from animals in a seafood market in Wuhan, where most of the infected people were found. The study didn't exclude the possibility of human-to-human transmission.


Singapore and Hong Kong have intensified screening for Wuhan airline passengers. From Friday, United States authorities declared similar measures for San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York major airports.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Police_shoot_man_dead_after_%27terrorist-related%27_knife_attack_in_London,2020-02-05,Police shoot man dead after 'terrorist-related' knife attack in London,"On Sunday in London, England, according to witness accounts and authorities, a man wearing a fake suicide vest entered a store, grabbed a large knife, ran outside with it and began to stab people. Reportedly he injured a man and two women on Streatham High Road, London. Armed plainclothes officers, already surveilling him for counter-terrorism purposes, chased him on foot. The officers eventually shot him dead, reportedly outside a Boots store, at around 14:00 local time in what the police declared a ""terrorist-related"" attack.


An eyewitness described for news agency PA Media how the attack unfolded, stating, ""I was crossing the road when I saw a man with a machete and silver canisters on his chest being chased by what I assume was an undercover police officer [...] The man was then shot. I think I heard three gunshots but I can't quite remember.""


Two women and a man were injured, according to the reports. The man was briefly listed in critical condition. A woman had minor injuries reportedly from glass shattering after police discharged their firearms, and the remaining woman was in ""not life-threatening"" condition.


The attacker, identified as Sudesh Amman, 20, was placed under police surveillance after being released from prison a week ago. He was imprisoned in 2018 when he was 18 and served half his sentence for 13 separate terror offenses. Amman, who was described as ""knife-obsessed"" by the police, sent his girlfriend videos of beheadings and extremist text messages, and advised her to kill her ""kuffar"" (non-Muslim) parents. He told her on one occasion: ""If you can't make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack the tourists (crusaders), police and soldiers of taghut [idolatry], or western embassies in every country you are in this planet.""


—The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan

Alexis Boon, the head of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command, said about Amman: ""His fascination with dying in the name of terrorism was clear in a notepad we recovered from his home. Amman had scrawled his 'life goals' in the notepad and top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to 'Jannah' — the afterlife. It's not clear how Amman became radicalised but it is apparent from his messages that it had been at least a year in development. Whatever the circumstances, this case is a reminder of the need to be vigilant to signs of radicalisation and report it.""


Police also recovered a bomb-making guidebook in his position and, on investigation in his family home in London, a black flag and an air gun.


The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, thanked ""the police, security and emergency services staff for their swift and courageous response"".


""Terrorists seek to divide us and to destroy our way of life,"" said Khan, ""here in London we will never let them succeed.""


The prime minister, Boris Johnson, tweeted: ""Thank you to all emergency services responding to the incident in Streatham, which the police have now declared as terrorism-related. My thoughts are with the injured and all those affected.""

As of yesterday, the virus had reportedly killed at least 813 in China and infected around 35,000 worldwide in at least 28 countries.


According to the U.S. embassy in Beijing, the infected 60-year-old western man died in February 6; Chinese authorities referred to him as ""Chinese-American."" Japanese officials said the Japanese man showed symptoms similar to the coronavirus infection and was suspected to have it; his death, they reported, was officially described as viral pneumonia.


Chinese citizens have criticized their government's initial response to the outbreak.  Police detained eight people for ""spreading rumors,"" including ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who tried to warn people about the viral outbreak in December.  Li died of the infection on Friday, which quickly became the most frequently discussed subject on the Chinese social networking platform Weibo.  The hashtag ""#we want freedom of speech#"" quickly reached at least about two million views before being deleted by censors.


The government of China has quarantined a number of cities over the virus.


Governments in east Asia have prevented at least two cruise ships from disembarking at their intended ports because some of the people on board tested positive for coronavirus.


In addition to the deaths recorded in China, one person in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong have died of this new coronavirus.

The Democratic and Republican parties use the primaries to select their nominees for the 2020 United States presidential election. Both Trump and Sanders also won the primary elections in New Hampshire in 2016.


Sanders, a Senator from Vermont, won the Democratic primary with 25.7% of the vote. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, came in second with 24.4% of the vote. Both earned 9 delegates, followed by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, with 6. None of the other candidates secured delegates, with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts coming in fourth with 9.2% of the vote.


Trump, the incumbent President of the United States, won the Republican primary with more than 85% of the vote. Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, received 9% of the vote. 


Following the Democratic primary, three candidates withdrew from the race: Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur, and Michael Bennet, a Senator from Colorado, suspended their campaigns the same day. Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, ended his on Wednesday morning.


New Hampshire held the campaign season's first round of primary elections, following the first round of caucuses in Iowa on February 3, which Iowa uses instead of primaries. NBC News reported on Sunday the Iowa Democratic Party had finalized the division of the state's 41 pledged delegates: Pete Buttigieg secured the most delegates, at 14, followed by Bernie Sanders, with 12. Elizabeth Warren earned 8 delegates, Joe Biden earned 6, and Amy Klobuchar earned the remaining 1.


In the Republican Iowa caucuses, ABC News reported President Trump is expected to win the eventual nomination, but only secured 39 of the state's 40 delegates. Bill Weld secured the remaining 1.


The Democratic party is scheduled to continue its primary season with the Nevada caucuses on February 22, followed by the South Carolina primary election on February 29. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the next Republican primary election or caucus is scheduled for March 3, when both parties are to hold more than a dozen primary elections.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/World_Health_Organization_names_new_coronavirus_COVID-19,2020-02-14,World Health Organization names new coronavirus COVID-19,"On Tuesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the official name of the coronavirus-induced disease first recognized about two months ago in Wuhan, China: ""COVID-19"" is to replace the WHO's temporary designation ""2019-nCoV.""


""COVID-19"" is the name of the disease rather than the virus. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the virus that causes it ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2).


Reportedly, ""COVI"" represents the coronavirus, ""D"" is for ""disease,"" and ""19"" for the year it was first detected, 2019.


WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the name had to be easy to say and, to prevent stigma, it must not cite any specific person, animal, profession or place, per WHO guidelines established in 2015.


The guidelines cite the 2009 H1N1 outbreak as an example of what not to do. That year's H1N1 was commonly called ""swine flu."" The government of Egypt ordered the killing of over 300,000 pigs. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization's chief veterinary officer, it was completely unnecessary. The guidelines also list Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, from 2013, as an undesirable name.


In an interview with Time magazine, Northwestern University public health expert Wendy Parmet said naming the virus after Wuhan would place ""tremendous stigmatization on the people of Wuhan who are the victims[.]"" She went on to say, ""People tend to think of the disease as belonging to, as being a characteristic of some group of people associated with the place name, which can be really stigmatizing [...] To be thought of as a hole of disease is not going to be productive. It encourages the next city not to come forward, not to report a disease if your city is labeled as the disease. [...] You want something that's easy and that people are going to keep using otherwise they're going to substitute it with more problematic slang[.]""


Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security medical anthropologist Monica Schoch-Spana told the press in a separate interview, ""People with a different national, ethnic or religious background have historically been accused of spreading germs regardless of what the science may say[.]"" As of Tuesday there had been reports of people avoiding or harassing Chinese and perceived-to-be Chinese individuals in several countries over the current outbreak, including Italy, the United States, Thailand, and Canada.


SARS-CoV-2 has already killed more than 1,000 people and infected tens of thousands.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/California_lawyer_Michael_Avenatti_convicted_of_attempted_extortion,2020-02-15,California lawyer Michael Avenatti convicted of attempted extortion,"Yesterday, a United States federal jury convicted Michael Avenatti, the California, US lawyer who represented porn star Stormy Daniels in her lawsuit against US President Donald Trump, of trying to extort Nike, an athletic equipment company. The trial was held in Manhattan, and was one of three facing Avenatti. He was also accused of defrauding clients in California, and of keeping for himself money that his client Stormy Daniels had earned from her book.


The United States government accused Avenatti of trying of pressure Nike for about 15–25 million dollars, threatening to give a news conference that would damage the company's stock price, as well as its reputation. Avenatti pled not guilty to the charges. His legal team argued he simply represented his client, Gary Franklin, in a negotiation. The government suggested Avenatti's debt was a factor in his decision making; according to prosecutors, he owed over $850,000 to the Internal Revenue Service, as well as penalties and interest, and in total was at least $11 million in debt at the time.


Avenatti was charged with three distinct crimes: transmission of interstate communications with intent to extort, attempted extortion, and honest services wire fraud. He was found guilty on all counts.  Together, the crimes carry a prison term of up to 42 years. NBC News reported Avenatti is to be sentenced in June.


Scott Srebnick, a member of Avenatti's legal team, announced Avenatti intended to appeal the conviction.

All of the pardons issued were ""full and unconditional"". The commutations included, among others, Democrat Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois; Trump is a Republican.


Rod Blagojevich was jailed for corruption after he tried to sell Barack Obama's former U.S. Senate seat after Obama was elected president, among other charges. He was sentenced to fourteen years in prison, serving eight before being granted clemency. According to CNN, multiple officials pressured Trump not to commute Blagojevich's sentence, including Republican members of the House of Representatives Darin LaHood and Mike Bost.


Judith Negron was convicted of both health care fraud and conspiracy to commit the same, money laundering and conspiracy to commit the same, and multiple other crimes. Negron served eight years of a thirty-five year sentence before being granted clemency.


Crystal Munoz was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 1,000 or more kilograms of marijuana in 2008 in the Western District of Texas, and was sentenced to serve 188 months (15 years, 8 months) in prison. Her sentence was commuted after serving twelve years.


Tynice Nichole Hall was convicted of multiple drug violations, as well as related charges involving possession of a firearm, in 2006 in the Northern District of Texas. She was granted clemency after serving almost fourteen years of an eighteen-year prison sentence.


Trump granted Angela Ronae Stanton a full and unconditional pardon. Stanton was convicted of conspiracy to transport in interstate commerce a stolen motor vehicle and tampering with a vehicle identification number in 2007 in the Northern District of Georgia.


Trump granted Ariel Manuel Friedler a full and unconditional pardon. Friedler, formerly the president and chief executive officer of Virginia-based Symplicity Corporation, pled guilty to conspiring to hack into the computer systems of two competitors to improve his company’s software development and sales strategy. He was sentenced to two months in prison in the Eastern District of Virginia in 2014.


Trump granted David Hossein Safavian, formerly the General Services Administration's chief of staff, a full and unconditional pardon. Safavian was charged with making false statements (perjury) and obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation into the activities of former Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff. He was convicted in 2006. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated his conviction and ordered a new trial, where in 2008 he was again found guilty.


In 1990, Michael Robert Milken pled guilty to charges related to his time as bond department head at Drexel Burnham Lambert, an investment bank. The charges included securities fraud, mail fraud, and tax fraud. Trump granted Milken a full and unconditional pardon.


Trump granted Paul Harvey Pogue a full and unconditional pardon. Pogue, the founder of Pogue Construction, was convicted of submitting a false tax return in 2010 in the Eastern District of Texas. Pogue's cause was reportedly helped by Rick Santorum, who mentioned Pogue's conviction to Trump.


Trump granted Bernard Bailey Kerik a full and unconditional pardon. Kerik, a former commissioner of the New York police, was convicted of making false statements (perjury) and obstructing the administration of the Internal Revenue Laws, among other crimes, in 2010 in the Southern District of New York.


Trump granted Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. a full and unconditional pardon. DeBartolo, who used to own the San Francisco 49ers football team, was convicted of misprision (concealment) of a felony in 1998 in the Middle District of Louisiana.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/COVID-19_may_spread_like_flu,_say_scientists",2020-02-22,"COVID-19 may spread like flu, say scientists","In a report released in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, scientists studying patients in Zhuhai in China's Guangdong Province reported that the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, may spread in a manner similar to influenza — suggesting, experts noted, that this outbreak, which began in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province in December 2019, may call for containment measures similar to those for influenza.


Researchers used polyester swab samples from the noses and throats of eighteen infected volunteers, including one asymptomatic infected volunteer. They found the virus's behavior resembled that of influenza rather than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), even though SARS-CoV-2 is more closely related to the viruses that cause SARS — hence its name — than to a typical influenza virus.


In humans, SARS viruses tend to live in the lower respiratory tract, where they can cause pneumonia. The COVID-19 virus, however, can live in both the lower and upper respiratory tract: the researchers found significant quantities of virus in samples taken from the volunteers' noses and throats. This and the fact that one of the volunteers had no symptoms while others had only mild ones raises the concern that, like a flu virus, SARS-CoV-2 could be spread directly from person to person by people who do not realize that they are putting others in danger.


Immunologist Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research said, in response to the study, ""This virus is clearly much more capable of spreading between humans than any other novel coronavirus we've ever seen. This is more akin to the spread of flu[.]""


Efforts to contain the SARS outbreak, which took place in 2003, mainly involved preventing the spread of the virus within hospitals. If these findings are accurate, scientists say, containing COVID-19 may require a different approach.


The R0 number for SARS-CoV-2 — the number of other people to whom each infected person transmits the virus before either dying or becoming noncontagious — has yet to be calculated. R0 can change over time as populations become more resistant, more vaccinated, or more careful. For context, SARS-CoV has a basic R0 estimated in the range 2–4 and influenza in the range 2–3. The measles R0 is about 12–18. Ebola and HIV have R0 values of about 2. Generally, outbreaks with R0 values under 1 end on their own and those with values over 1 do not.

The president had previously called it ""a matter of public health"".


""[W]ithin the next 10 days, I will present a bill for the voluntary interruption of pregnancy that legalises abortion at the initial time of pregnancy and allows women to access the health system when they make the decision to abort"", Fernández said.  Thousands of people had gathered outside the National Congress with slogans supporting the legalisation of abortion of pregnancy.


Abortion of pregnancy is currently illegal in the Catholic-majority country, and is permitted only in two cases: if the pregnancy was a product of rape, or if it poses a risk to the woman.  Fernández said the law has ""condemned many women, generally of limited resources, to resort to abortive practices in absolute secrecy, putting their health and sometimes their lives at risk"".


Estimates by the Argentinian government state about 350 thousand illegal abortions are carried out in the country each year.  Illegal abortion is a crime punishable with a prison term in the Latin American country since 1921.  Saying ""there are many abortions despite the criminal threat"" ((es))Spanish language: ‍hay muchos abortos pese a la amenaza penal, President Fernández elaborated, ""A state that is present must protect citizens in general and obviously women in particular.  And in the 21st Century, every society needs to respect the individual choice of its members to decide freely about their bodies ((es))Spanish language: ‍En el siglo XXI, toda sociedad necesita respetar la decisión individual de sus miembros para disponer libremente de sus cuerpos"".


Following the president's announcements, the director of Argentina's Amnesty International, Mariela Belski, said the president had ""heard the demands of women, adolescents and girls"".


The proceedings of the abortion rights was criticised by archbishop Monsenor Jorge Eduardo Scheinig.  Calling it a ""culture of death"" the archbishop said ""We need to pray so that in Argentina, the yes to life is stronger than death.""


Uruguay, Guyana and Cuba are the other Latin American countries where abortion during the early weeks of pregnancy is legal.  Back in 2018, the Argentine congress approved a bill legalising abortion, but it was dismissed by the senate.

In the aftermath of Super Tuesday, yesterday and on Wednesday, two candidates, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael Bloomberg, formerly the mayor of New York City, ended their campaigns.


The name ""Super Tuesday"" comes from the large number of primaries and caucuses held on the same day. The states that held elections were Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Together with American Samoa, the state contests represented a total of 1,357 delegates to the Democratic nominating convention.


The Democratic Party uses primary elections, along with caucuses, to select its nominee for the 2020 United States presidential election. For a candidate to win the Democratic Party's nomination, a total of at least 1,991 delegates are needed.


* Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropped out prior to Super Tuesday


The Super Tuesday primaries were the fifth step in the Democratic Party's primary election cycle. In Iowa, caucuses were held on February 3, and in New Hampshire, a primary election was held on February 11. Nevada held its caucuses on February 22, and South Carolina held its primary on Saturday.


Heading into Super Tuesday, Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont had the most pledged delegates, with 60. In second place, former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden had 54. Additionally, Senator Warren had eight delegates. Both Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota secured delegates in earlier primaries and caucuses, but they both ended their campaigns prior to Super Tuesday.


On Super Tuesday, Sanders secured a plurality of the vote in four states, including his home state of Vermont, according to CNN's projections. Projections by CNN and NPR indicated he won, in addition to Vermont, also the primaries in Colorado, Utah, and California.


Former Vice-President Biden secured pluralities in ten states. According to projections by CNN and NPR, he won in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Minnesota, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Texas, and Maine.


Bloomberg won the caucus in American Samoa, his first of the campaign season. Bloomberg had opted not to compete in the four earlier primaries and caucuses, instead focusing on Super Tuesday. By reports he secured five of the territory's six delegates, as well as three delegates in Colorado and one in Arkansas. U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii secured the last delegate from American Samoa, her first delegate of the campaign season.


Wednesday, the same day that he dropped out, Bloomberg endorsed his former rival, Joe Biden.  ""Three months ago,"" he said, ""I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump. Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump – because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult [...] I've always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday's vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden. [...] Today I am glad to endorse him – and I will work to make him the next President of the United States.""


Warren, formerly a professor at Harvard Law School, lost her home state of Massachusetts. She came in third; Biden secured a plurality, and Sanders came in second. Yesterday, NBC News reported that Warren would be suspending her campaign. She did not win the primary or caucus in any state during her campaign.


NPR reported that, before she ended her campaign, Klobuchar was leading in the polls in Minnesota; Minnesota is Klobuchar's home state.


The Democratic Party awards delegates proportionally to how candidates fare; candidates must receive at least 15% of the vote to be eligible to earn delegates from a state, territory, or district within a state or territory.

The state-run Indian Railways launched this event ahead of International Women's Day, for promoting gender equality at work places.


B Shiva Parvathi  was running the train as loco pilot (locomotive pilot), and 22-year-old Rangoli Patil was her loco co-pilot.  The train left Mysore Junction railway station at 11:30 am IST (0600 UTC), covering a distance of 139km to reach KSR Bangalore station.  The train had banners on it which mentioned ""International Women's Day Celebration"".


Speaking to newspaper Star of Mysore, B Shiva Parvathi said, ""It is a proud moment for me to be steering this train today along with my Loco Pilot Rangoli and the all-women staff"".  Mysore Divisional Railway Manager Aparna Garg told Wikinews only 10% of the employees in the Mysore Division were women, which constitutes about 650 female employees.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Wikinews_discusses_International_Women%27s_Day_celebration_with_Mysore_Divisional_Railway_Manager,2020-03-08,Wikinews discusses International Women's Day celebration with Mysore Divisional Railway Manager,"This Thursday, an all-women crew ran the Mysore–Bangalore Tippu Express in the Indian state of Karnataka.  The state-run Indian Railways launched this event ahead of International Women's Day, for promoting gender equality at work places.  Aparna Garg — who has been the Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) for Mysore Division for almost two years — discussed this initiative with Wikinews.  International Women's Day is observed on March 8.


Good afternoon, ma'am.  Thank you for agreeing to this interview.  Allow me to congratulate Mysuru Division for this all-women crew — the crew which ran the Tippu Express from Mysore to Bangalore on Thursday.  How many employees were there in this all-women crew?


((Aparna Garg))  There were fifteen of them.  A crew per-se combines only the loco pilot (locomotive pilot) and the guard.  But all the people who ran [the train], it includes the ticket checking staff, the escort staff, the RPF (Railway Police Force) staff.  So combining everybody, it was around fifteen people.


((WN))  How rare is it to have all-women crew running the train?


((Aparna Garg))  Yeah, it is really rare.  Actually, we are in a process of a ten-day campaign for International Women's Day and we have lined up one activity each day.  So this initiative was a part of that campaign.


((WN))   Was it the first time an all-women crew ran the train in the Southern Western Railway?


((Aparna Garg))   No, not really.  It has been done in other divisions as well.  Mysore, maybe the first time.


((WN))  Has it ever happened before in any other regional divisions which you are aware of?


((Aparna Garg))  I think in Bangalore they did a little bit.  Whether it was all-women, but they did run a train.  And all-India basis also they have done.


((WN))  Could you please tell us more about this feat, and when was this planned?


((Aparna Garg))  As I told you, that we have a ten-day campaign running for International Women's Day, the theme of which is ""Each for Equal"".  And ""Each for Equal"" is basically each of us can contribute in creating a gender-equal world.  Each area they [women] are working, it is not getting highlighted at all.  There are basically male-dominated areas where earlier women were not coming.  But nowadays, we see in large number, the women come.  And in railways, these are [rare] works: loco pilot, working as a keyman; keyman means basically it is designation ""keyman"" but when woman works, it could be keywoman: they have to patrol on the tracks.  So there are these people who are working so hard, [?] checking the trains completely.  So that is why we decided to give it publicity and make it an all-women crew.


((WN))  Was this event planned by the Southern Western Railway, or was it an Indian Railways initiative?


((Aparna Garg))  This was an initiative of Mysore Division.  Mysore Division is a part of South Western Railway.


((WN))  What has the Indian Railways planned for this International Women's Day?


((Aparna Garg))  They have given a theme of different things to be done.  The campaign theme, as I told you, ""Each for Equal"", which can significantly and collectively, each one of us can help create a gender-equal world.


And from 1st of March to 10th of March we have to celebrate, then we have to organise some talks, lectures; then, basically, anything which comes in the public purview to highlight the steps taken by Indian Railways for the empowerment of women, enhancing the role of women in all fields.  And [...] basically take steps for the female staff of our division.  Social media posts we have to do of whatever we are doing [for the celebration].  Women-specific videos, we have to add.


What we are doing in Mysore division, we did a couple of activities: [...] we had a medical check-up, specifically screening for cervical cancer.  Not only for the staff working in the office, but also for the contract staff.  The cleaning staff which you see on the station, they are not permanent employees.  And they don't have access to good health.  There are a lot of ladies working there.  Today, I took a lot of ladies who were working in the division office as well as our field for a trek to Chamundi Temple.  So we went [in the] morning there.  And tomorrow we have some event planned.


((WN))  Could you please tell us about this year's theme, the celebration of Women's Day, and how is it different from last year's?


((Aparna Garg))  Last year, it was basically focused on the particular day, 8th [March] alone.  The idea of spreading it over ten days is very significant.


((WN))  What are the activities planned in this phase?


((Aparna Garg))  Basically our aim is to encourage lot of participation by women employees in different activities other than their office work, so they get a break.  This is for our own employees.  Promote them.  Encourage them.  Create awareness about their own talent.  Like, within the office, we organised ""pick-and-speak"" or some things like that and a lot of such events, where we found that even our Group D staff are so talented, some of them.  So basically giving them a break from their routine.  That was one for our female employees.  And we are trying to take care of the staff that are working at the station as well as to the women passengers providing enhanced security.


((WN))  Would you call this event a success?


((Aparna Garg))  Yeah, so far, yes.


((WN))  What are the challenges faced by women working for Indian Railways?


((Aparna Garg))  Challenges, I would say, are the same as you find in the society.  For a women to achieve something, is not as easy as it is for a man.  They have to put double the effort, and the recognition comes very late.  And then women are multi-tasking everywhere.  So a lady who comes to work in the office: first sees her house and then she comes [to work] and then again she goes back and she does [household work].  So she is much more pressure, and I find them very sincere.  Despite all the pressure, I find them extremely sincere and dedicated.


((WN))  What are the possible remedies to these issues?


((Aparna Garg))  Issues are basically: celebration of Women's Day and all these events, they do bring women in focus.  But what is required at large is a change in the society and the mindset, which should begin in each house.  And if we have boys in the house and we have male colleagues, we have to sensitise them more.  And so that, once we have the support of these people and their mindset changes, and that is how we can influence the collective consciousness.


((WN))  What is the gender-distribution ratio at the Mysore Division branch?


((Aparna Garg))  Mysore Division, we have ten percent only women employees.  Out of a total of, say, 6900 [employees], we have around 650.  So that is around ten percent.


((WN))  Are you happy with this number?


((Aparna Garg))  Yeah, it is okay.  See, the idea is: each according to their choice.  The people who have chosen [to work here] have gotten.  I personally don't believe in this too much of gender-bias.  They are all individuals.


((WN))  Has this number been improving in the past years?


""More number of women getting into technical fields has been a big change.""  — ‍Aparna Garg, Mysore Divisional Railway Manager


((Aparna Garg))  It has improved.  It has improved, it was around seven or eight percent, over the two years it has increased.  More number of women getting into technical fields has been a big change.  Earlier it wasn't coming.  You would find in office staff, okay, which is a ministerial cadre.  But now, getting women employees in loco pilot category, in station masters, as guards, as pointswoman: they are all working [on] track, as carriage and wagon helpers.  So yes, there has been a change.


[Women] loco pilots are coming in a big wave.  And it is not a very difficult job.  The duty hours is eight-hours.  So once they cover eight hours, they change.  So it is not that in some remote areas they have to drive.  No.  Eight hours, their shift changes.  So if a loco pilot starts from here, maybe at Arsikere or some place, they will change.  So we have something called running rooms, where the have all the facilities.  So they deboard there, and after taking due rest, they take a train back to their home place.  So yes, ladies are coming in a big wave.


((WN))  What are the steps Indian Railways is taking for improving this number?


((AN))  There is not [gender-based] reservation per-se, [from] what I know, but Indian [Railways] has been very open about it.  Now you see DRM's, I am sitting here.  There was a time when the number of ladies who'd become DRM was very less.  So now, we have around 60 division, maybe eight are women.  So the numbers: everywhere it is going up.  It has been very positive about it.


((WN))  Can you brief me your role as Mysore Divisional Railway Manager?


((Aparna Garg))  As Divisional Railway Manager, I am in charge of all the operations, all the train running, and my division is around 1300 route kilometres.  It extends from Chamarajanagar.  It goes right up to, just short of Hubli up to Karajagi.  And on the other side, next to Tumkuru.  It starts and then goes up to Mangalore this side.  Including Hassan and some more branch lines are there which goes up to Chikmagalur and goes up to Raidurga.  So this is my jurisdiction.  I have a set of 30 officers with me.  A lot of supervisors and other staff.  Total staff, I told you, is around 6900 for Mysore division.  And controlling everyday basically taking the team along, taking decisions, small-small decisions which help in running of the train, carrying out all the initiatives and directions of the ministry is my job.


((WN))  For how long have you been working here as the Mysore Division Railway Manager?


((Aparna Garg))  I will be completing my two years' tenure in April.


((WN))  Can you please brief me about your career highlights so far?


((Aparna Garg))  My career highlights have been opting for civil services at a very young age, in my first attempt was [the] first important step in my career.  Otherwise in my student days there were many things that I did.  I was a student leader.  I had other achievements.  But coming to the career, and thereafter, I [had] initially joined Western Railway.  But then came down to South, and I worked in different capacities.  Then, after a few years into the service, I was selected for the Chevening Fellowship in [the] UK, where I did my advanced masters and postgraduate in transport economics.  That was a big achievement because very few years into service having been selected for that: it was a completely scholarship programme, I did not have to pay for it.  So that was a big achievement.  Then, while I was posted in the construction wing, making a software programme for: making means piloting a state of art system [which was] Oracle-based for project management.  It was integrated with financial management personal management system as well as store's material management.  So piloting that completely, that I would call it as a big highlight.  And then getting posted as a Divisional Railway Manager: there were a lot of challenges.  Challenge was: the railway station which you see, it was a big project.  Working station, improving that, improving the circulating area and then retaining the heritage, and enhancing it faced a lot of flak and opposition also.  Because when we do the work, everything looks like in the stage of construction.  So you get all type[s] of things.  And then still continuing to do; and I have taken a few more challenging works in the division.  One is adjacent to our sports ground, there is [an] area which is not very clean.  So I have decided to clean it up and make it an ecospace.  That project we are working on.  The railway museum, which is a must-visit for people, and it's been a 40 years old museum.  [In 19]79-80 it was established in a small area.  After that, it has not been taken care of so much that the condition was not good.  And this was a sanctioned project ten years back.  But work had not happened.  It was very very challenging what we have done.  And we are soon going to open it on 14th.  [...] Even Mysore Yard remodelling.  We were not able to push our trains from all the platforms towards Ashokapuram-side.  And we were not able to simultaneously receive train from Hassan-side and SBC (KSR Bangalore)-side.  If a train from Bangalore-side is coming, that would stop.  So there were a lot of yard changes which had to be done.  Including our interlocking software.  This was also very challenging which required a year of planning.  We did this successfully.  So like this, there were small-small works which were all pending, and which were not done.  So we have done a very comprehensive work.  But credit will go to the team also.


((WN))  How is South West Railway and Mysore Division taking precaution against the spread of coronavirus?


((Aparna Garg))  My CMD [Chief Health Director], I have been talking to her everyday.  We have an isolation ward in the hospital but at the station, I think, we are playing a clip about the precautions to be taken.  If we come to know, we should take more cautions.  Basically the citizens have travelled to these places: like China, South Korea and people from the far East have been coming.  So we should announce and we should isolate them.  We are yet to put a segregated space in station.  That we have not done.  But I think, announcements and all we are doing.  And if I come to know here, masks and all: we are distributing.  And more important is here, the staff who is dealing with the public on a daily basis like out ticket collectors and guards and all, they have been given masks.


((WN))  Thank you very much.  That would be all the questions I had for you.

The NBA's decision followed a Utah Jazz player testing positive for the COVID-19 virus.


The NBA did not release the identity of the player in question in its announcement. They did say he was not present at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, where the Utah Jazz were to play against the Oklahoma City Thunder.


According to its press release, the NBA was ""suspending game play following the conclusion of [Wednesday's] schedule of games until further notice."" The Jazz's game was cancelled, as was another NBA game Wednesday between the Sacramento Kings and the New Orleans Pelicans. Other games scheduled for Wednesday were still held, according to NBC News.


The United States' other major basketball organization, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which runs college basketball, has cancelled its own tournament, March Madness, for both men's and women's leagues.


According to Johns Hopkins University, as of Wednesday, there were at least 1,279 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States. CNBC reported there were at least 118,381 cases worldwide.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Stores_in_Australia_lower_toilet_paper_limits_per_transaction,2020-03-13,Stores in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction,"On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two and one package per transaction in all stores on national level, respectively. ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday. These limitations were posted as messages on the checkouts, and on the chains' Facebook pages. Buyers were reportedly stocking up due to fears of COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate. On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order.


These changes followed the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively. Coles, in its March 8 media release, reported that with the four-pack restriction in place, ""many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery"", and called the demand ""unprecedented"", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it ""unexpected"". Sales went up in a ""sharp increase"" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.  Costco's store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week. 


To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered bigger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made stocks for a planned Wednesday special available early. Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers try to raise stock, but local council restrictions on the timing of truck-deliveries make it hard. He expects rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer specials. On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early release of stock, some stores can't run the Wednesday special.


In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the stores fill the stock every night. He remarked toilet paper is a bulky item, leading to low quantity of stocks in numbers, and, when sold out, leaves vast shelf spaces empty, hardening the feeling of a shortage. ""Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there was plenty of stuff on the shelf, if product like toilet rolls and sanitiser could be [bought] and are there in quantities, you would probably minimise the panic"" said Russell Zimmerman per ABC News.


Recycled toilet paper producer Who Gives a Crap said on last Wednesday they'd run out of stock. Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent, emphasized they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the News.com.au report.


Domain.com, a real estate site, reported some property sellers offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because of buyers having time off on the long weekend of Labour Day. The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert meant to be cut up and used as toilet paper.


The stores were originally reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on the purchases.


Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitiser, dried goods, handwash and flour. Similarly, outside of Australia, on Sunday evening online British supermarket Ocado was observed limiting purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.

Although the word ""pandemic"" only refers to how widely a disease has spread, not how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO noted the need to drive governments to action: ""All countries can still change the course of this pandemic. If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize their people in the response,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the WHO. ""We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction.""


According to Dr. Tom Frieden, formerly the director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is ""unprecedented."" He said, in remarks published by CNN in February, ""[o]ther than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence to continuous global spread.""


Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying ""[w]e have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus."" He continued, ""[a]nd we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.""


The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's director, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, ""[b]ottom line, it's going to get worse.""


As of Thursday, Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Native_American_groups_sue_US_state_of_Montana_over_ballot_law,2020-03-15,Native American groups sue US state of Montana over ballot law,"On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana and Native American Rights Fund filed a lawsuit against the state of Montana over its 2018 Ballot Interference Prevention Act (BIPA), saying it would prevent many Native Americans from voting.


Reportedly, most Montana residents vote through the mail, including 73% of votes in the 2018 midterm elections.  Since the United States Postal Service does not cover most Native American reservations, many of the people who live there fill out their ballots and give them to voting organizations to deliver to election offices on their behalf. The complaint notes many residents of Montana's reservations do not have access to reliable transportation to drive to voting sites.


Under the previous law, each carrier was limited to 80 of other people's ballots, unless they were part of the voter's family. Under BIPA, that number drops to six. The fine for breaking this law was set at US$500.


The Native American Rights Fund's Jacqueline De León said, ""BIPA ignores the everyday realities that face Native American communities. It is not reasonable to expect voters to drive an hour to drop off their ballot, so collecting ballots in reservation communities just makes sense. Criminalizing this behavior is unfair to Native American voters and does nothing to solve the real problem of mail not being picked up and delivered to Native homes.""


State legislators supporting the law argued it was to prevent voter fraud, specifically to prevent people from collecting ballots and then throwing them away if they did not like voters' decisions. Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton said BIPA ""is supported overwhelmingly by Montanans, including the counties in Indian Country [...] It's always dicey when plaintiffs try to overturn the will of the people.""


As of 2020, Montana had seven Native American reservations with about 70,000 people living on them.  The World Population Review estimated the total 2020 population of the state at just over one million.


The plaintiffs were listed as Western Native Voice, Montana Native Vote, Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of Fort Peck, Blackfeet Nation, Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, Crow Tribe, and the Fort Belknap Indian Community. The suit was filed in Yellowstone County.


An issue raised by the complaint was BIPA's definition of the term ""family."" Many of the Native American cultures in Montana, the complaint pointed out, have a concept of family that does not match the nuclear family idea widespread in Western culture.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/US_President_Trump_declares_COVID-19_national_emergency,2020-03-16,US President Trump declares COVID-19 national emergency,"On Friday, United States President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The move came two days after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak, which causes the COVID-19 disease, to be a pandemic.


The move gives the federal government access to around US$50 billion in extra funding to combat the pandemic, according to NBC News.


The proclamation specifically said ""the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency"" and said the national emergency began on March 1, almost two weeks before the proclamation itself. The United States Department of Health and Human Services declared the outbreak a ""public health emergency"" on January 31.


Trump did not place the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in charge of the government's response to COVID-19, which Politico reported left some experts in disaster management disappointed. Politico quoted Tim Manning, formerly a deputy administrator at FEMA, as saying ""FEMA has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis"" and ""[i]f there's an emergency, FEMA needs to be involved.""


Trump made the decision under provisions of the National Emergencies Act, amongst other governing authorities. The Trump administration also announced other efforts in response to COVID-19, including waiving the interest it collects on federal student loans and increasing U.S. strategic oil reserve oil purchases.

The party was organised by Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (All India Hindu Union) president Swami Chakrapani where the attendees consumed cow urine to prevent themselves from being infected by the coronavirus.  Reuters estimated around 200 people attended the event held at the Indian capital city of New Delhi.


Speaking to Reuters, an attendee Om Prakash said, ""We have been drinking cow urine for 21 years, we also take bath in cow dung. We have never felt the need to consume English medicine"".


A yajña (literally means sacrifice, devotion, worship, or offering) was conducted at the start of the meeting and a poster of coronavirus, personified as an avatar of the Hindu god Narsimha, was displayed.  At the event, ABHM president Chakrapani said ""Coronavirus has come because of the people who kill and eat animals. When you kill an animal, it creates a sort of energy that causes destruction in that place"".


In February, Chakrapani said, ""Corona is not a virus, but avatar for the protection of poor creatures. They have come to give the message of death and punishment to the one who eats them"".


COVID-19 was previously announced to be a ""pandemic"" by the World Health Organization (WHO).  According to the WHO's situation report dated March 16, the virus claimed 6606 lives, and 167,515 cases were reported of this disease. The WHO's website said: ""While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. The WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.""


However, addressing the global leaders, Chakrapani proposed: ""I request all the presidents and prime ministers of the world to take cow urine on a daily basis. You have all these scientists who don't know the cure, we have the cure given to us by the gods"".


Chakrapani had said, ""Corona was quiet in India because of yajña rituals.

Cows are considered sacred by Hindus and politicians of the Hindu-nationalist party Bharatiya Janta Party had previously cited the medicinal benefits of cow urine.  Similar sentiment was shared by a Minister of Legislative Assembly from Assam earlier this month.  Suman Haripriya of the Hajo assembly said ""Coronavirus is an airborne disease and it can be cured by using gaumutra and cow dung.""


According to the reports by Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, there are at least 142 cases in India, of which three patients have died.  14 have recovered so far in the country.  Multiple schools and colleges are closed across the country as a precautionary measure to slow down the spread of this virus.  Passengers at airports are being screened to ensure safety.

By reports, former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden won all three elections. Ohio, which was also scheduled to hold a primary election, delayed its voting in the face of the national emergency around the spread of the COVID-19 disease. The same day, incumbent President of the United States Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for the 2020 United States presidential election after winning the party's primaries in Florida and Illinois.


The Democratic and Republican Parties use primary elections, along with caucuses, to select their nominees for the 2020 presidential election. For a candidate to win the Democratic Party's nomination, a total of at least 1,991 delegates are needed. The three primary elections the Democratic party held represented a total of 441 delegates.


Biden's victories in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois left him with a reported total of 1,124 pledged delegates; United States Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders trailed him with a total of 815. In the 2016 United States presidential election, Sanders also lost in all three of these states to Hillary Clinton. The Democratic Party awards delegates proportionally to how candidates fare; candidates must receive at least 15% of the vote to be eligible to earn delegates from a state, territory, or district within a state or territory.


On the Republican side, 1,276 delegates are required to secure the nomination. After winning the Republican Party's primaries in Florida and Illinois on Tuesday, Trump reportedly amassed 1,330 delegates, more than the number needed, making him the Republican Party's presumptive nominee.


—Mike DeWine, Twitter

In Ohio, which was planning to hold its primary election on Tuesday, Governor Mike DeWine postponed it, citing the health crisis. In a two-part statement on Twitter, he wrote, ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus."" He continued by announcing, ""As such, @DrAmyActon will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State @FrankLaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.""


DeWine's decision comes a few days after President Trump declared a national emergency in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The World Health Organization has classified the the outbreak of COVID-19 disease as a pandemic.


As of Tuesday, Ohio was one of six states that had decided to postpone its election. Maryland rescheduled most of its primary races to June 2; they were originally planned for April 28. It did not change the date of its special election to fill the United States House of Representatives seat formerly held by Elijah Cummings, but instead is to switch to mail-in voting only. Cummings died in October at the age of 68.


The Democratic National Committee urged states not to reschedule their elections but rather to use mail-in voting instead. Support for mail-in voting also came from United States Senator from Minnesota Amy Klobuchar. On Monday, Klobuchar, along with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, introduced a bill to require voting by mail in all states as an emergency measure. Klobuchar was herself a candidate in the 2020 presidential election before she ended her campaign.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Florida_frog_skull_survey_shows_spikes,_say_scientists",2020-03-26,"Florida frog skull survey shows spikes, say scientists","In a new study released by the Florida Museum of Natural History on Monday, scientists report spiky skulls evolved at least 25 separate times in different kinds of frogs. The survey was reportedly to be published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.


Lead author Daniel Paluh, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Florida, said, ""Superficially, frogs may look similar, but when you look at their skulls, you see drastic differences [...] Some of the weirdest skulls are found in frogs that eat birds and mammals, use their heads as a shield, or in a few rare cases, are venomous. Their skulls show how strange and diverse frogs can be.""


Some scientists had previously suggested smaller frogs would tend to develop spiky skulls, but that is not what this study reports.  Here, researchers evaluated CT scans on 158 different species. They found frogs that had similar ecological niches — meaning they either acquired food in the same way or defended themselves from predators in the same way — tended to develop skulls with similar grooves, spikes, or specialized jaw joints regardless of whether they were ancestrally related to each other.


According to the study, skulls with spikes, grooves or ridges — called hyperossification — often accompanied frogs eating very large prey relative to their own body size.  The strong, spacious skulls would allow the frogs to have very big mouths with which to catch birds, rodents, reptiles and other frogs.  Spikes sometimes coincided with venomous frogs. The researchers speculated the spikes make it dangerous for predators to hit the frog's head, as the spikes would break venom sacs under the frog's skin.


Other bone formations included projections resembling fangs or lower teeth  that different species of frogs use for catching prey and fighting. Very few frogs have true lower teeth.


One of the study's authors, herpetologist David Blackburn, told Discover Magazine the frequency of spiky skulls evolving in otherwise unrelated frogs suggested some deep pattern frogs fell into as circumstances arose: ""Somehow, these frogs are turning on some ancient developmental machinery in their DNA.""


Since 1973, when frogs skulls were last comprehensively surveyed, scientists have documented enough new species to double the number known to humans.  Also, modern techniques exploit CT scans, of which Paluh and his team made liberal use.  The research was part of the oVert project, funded by the National Science Foundation, meant to comprehensively CT-scan over 20,000 vertebrate specimens from United States museums.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/SARS-CoV-2_surpasses_one_million_infections_worldwide,2020-04-05,SARS-CoV-2 surpasses one million infections worldwide,"On Thursday, the total number of cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections surpassed one million worldwide, Johns Hopkins University data indicated. At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.


The milestone came the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death. North Korea claimed, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries remaining free of coronavirus infections.


By yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty four hours preceding 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4. In the United States, over 244 thousand coronavirus cases were recorded, linking to at least 5,900 deaths. CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, there were over 1,000 US deaths on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.


Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the disease from spreading. On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city lockdown to May 1. Nationally, President Vladimir Putin declared Russians would continue to be paid without going to work until April 30. The parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions, and one vote against. Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to last the entire day; previously, the curfew was only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m. Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.

The elections came amidst concerns regarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease.


Wisconsin's elections included the Democratic and Republican Party's primary elections, and the general election for the race to fill a seat on the state's Supreme Court, among others. The Democratic and Republican Parties use primary elections, along with caucuses, to select their nominees for the 2020 United States presidential election. According to reports, all other US states with elections scheduled to occur in April either delayed their election or switched to entirely mail-in voting.


For a candidate to win the Democratic Party's nomination, a total of at least 1,991 delegates are needed. The Democratic Party awards delegates proportionally to how candidates fare; candidates must receive at least 15% of the vote to be eligible to earn delegates from a state, territory, or district within a state or territory. The Wisconsin primary represents 84 delegates. According to NPR, former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden has amassed 1,217 pledged delegates so far, while United States Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders has earned 914.


Yesterday, Tony Evers, the governor of Wisconsin, signed an executive order delaying the election until June, citing the health risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The move came after William Conley, a United States District judge, ordered last week that absentee ballots be accepted until April 13, and votes not be counted until then.


The decision was challenged in court, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Evers lacked authority to single-handedly reschedule Wisconsin's election. The United States Supreme Court later ruled against Conley's extension of absentee voting as well. Part of the court order that was not overturned declared that ballots would not be counted until 4 p.m. on April 13.


A number of poll workers quit ahead of Wisconsin's election, leading to the state using the National Guard to man polling booths. The city of Milwaukee reduced the number of polling stations from 180 to 5, leading to lines multiple blocks long outside of the polling stations.


Before the deadline last week, over a million people requested absentee ballots to vote by mail. According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, as of yesterday morning, over 500,000 ballots were not yet returned, and over 11,000 were not yet sent out.

This is the highest number of fatalities in a day due to the virus. As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying home. A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.


In an online news briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the fatalities included four males and one female. According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were aged above 60, two between 51 and 60, and one 41-50 years old. She also said two of the victims were from Dhaka. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.


A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.





On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be shut down for longer than initially planned, until this coming Saturday. This public transport shutdown had initially started on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4. Transport of essential goods -- medical, fuel and food -- was still allowed.


The first recorded incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them. As of March 19, these three had already recovered.

In a livestream, Sanders shared with his supporters his reasoning, pointing out he had secured around 300 delegates fewer than former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden, saying ""the path toward victory is virtually impossible"". For a candidate to win the Democratic Party's nomination, a total of at least 1,991 delegates are needed.


Sanders said in his live stream, ""I do not make this decision lightly"", calling it a ""difficult and painful decision"". He wrote in a tweet, ""while the campaign ends, the struggle for justice continues on"". He spoke about affordable higher education, healthcare, and raising the federal minimum wage to USD15 an hour in his announcement.


Sanders' exit from the race left Biden as the party's expected nominee. During an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Wednesday, Sanders called Biden a ""decent man"" but did not immediately offer a full endorsement. On the Republican side, incumbent President of the United States Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee in March.


Sanders was also a contender for the Democratic Party's nomination in the 2016 presidential election. Sanders lost the nomination in 2016 to former United States Secretary of State and former United States Senator from New York Hillary Clinton.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Iranian_International_Master_Dorsa_Derakhshani_discusses_her_chess_career_with_Wikinews,2020-04-14,Iranian International Master Dorsa Derakhshani discusses her chess career with Wikinews,"In February 2017, the Iranian Chess Federation announced two teenage chess players, Dorsa Derakhshani and her younger brother Borna Derakhshani, were banned from representing the national team.  The federation announced their decision although Dorsa Derakhshani had previously decided and informed the chess federation she did not wish to play for Iran.


Dorsa Derakhshani is currently 21 years old and holds the International Master (IM) as well as Woman Grand Master (WGM) titles.  Her brother, Borna, plays for the English Federation and holds the FIDE Master title.


Dorsa Derakhshani was banned since she did not wear a hijab, an Islamic headscarf, while competing at the Tradewise Gibraltar Chess Festival in January 2017.  Under the laws of Islamic Republic of Iran, hijab is a mandatory dress code.  Her brother Borna Deraskhsani was banned for playing against Israeli Grand Master (GM) Alexander Huzman at the same tournament.  Iran does not recognise the existence of Israel, and previously, Irani athletes have avoided playing against Israeli athletes.


Mehrdad Pahlavanzadeh, the president of the country's chess federation, explained the decision to ban the players saying, ""As a first step, these two will be denied entry to all tournaments taking place in Iran and in the name of Iran, they will no longer be allowed the opportunity to be present on the national team."" ((fa))Farsi language: ‍اولین اقدام ما این است که این افراد را از تمام مسابقاتی که در ایران و به نام ایران برگزار می‌شود، محروم می‌کنیم و دیگر شانس حضور در تیم ملی را نخواهند داشت.
  He further stated, ""Unfortunately, something that should not have happened has happened and our national interest is paramount and we have reported this position to the Ministry of Sports."" ((fa))Farsi language: ‍متاسفانه اتفاقی که نباید می‌افتاد، افتاده است و منافع ملی ما بر هر چیزی ارجحیت دارد و ما این موضع را به وزارت ورزش هم گزارش دادیم.

IM Dorsa Derakhshani, who currently studies at Saint Louis University in the United States and plays for the United States Chess Federation, discussed her chess career, time in Iran and the 2017 controversy, and her life in Saint Louis with a Wikinews correspondent.


IM Dorsa Derakhshani grew up in Tehran, and she had learned to read and write at a very young age because her parents were ""persistent"" about her education.  She remarked lack of chess tournaments in a country where ""women are seen as second-class citizens"" was one of the challenges she'd faced living in Iran.


Could you please tell us something about yourself?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I'm a professional chess player and right now I'm a pre-med student at Saint Louis University.


((WN))  What interested you in chess and who taught you this game?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I got interested in chess because of my dad.  He used to play in high school before the revolution in Iran.  But since after the revolution chess was banned for about ten years.  So he couldn't play in public, so he would just play in the house and I remember he used to play with my mom.  And, yeah, that's how I learned chess.


((WN))  What do your parents do?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  My dad is a doctor, he is a pædiatrist and family medicine.  My mom is a psychiatrist.


((WN))  How was your childhood like?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I was the first child, so they, my parents put a lot of effort into teaching me a lot of different skills.  So, for example, my parents really wanted me to start writing and solving puzzles as soon as possible.  So when I was two-and-a-half, I finished first grade.  I could do maths and read the books and write.  And they kept going.  So when I was a little over four, I finished fourth grade.  And so they wanted me to start fifth grade when I was five but the government didn't really have any protocols for this so they didn't allow me to skip classes.  And so my parents tried to fill my time with other activities such as ballet, painting, music, swimming, and eventually chess.  And chess was the one thing that I [jumped for consistently] because I really liked puzzle-solving and I really liked the winning, the competition.


((WN))  How did you train as a kid?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I always wanted to be the best at everything I was doing, and chess had the clear category of what I was best at.  And I really liked that.  Because for example in ballet or in painting, I was good, but, I wasn't sure what I was good at, just, was I good just for a kid my age, was I good just for the class I was in.  And in chess, one of the first tournaments that I played, I won the Girl's Under-8 National Championship.  So I knew clearly, I felt like clearly I was best at that.  And, yeah, I was very ambitious and competitive, I don't know why.


((WN))  When did you realise you were a serious talent?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))   My middle and my high school, I went to the organisation which is called SAMPAD .  It's an acronym for, hold on, let me look that up.  It's called the National Organization for Extraordinary something.  I will look that up in just a second.  So I knew that I had the ambition and I had the brain because I used to be a TV host when I was a kid and it was always very easy for me.  It wasn't very stressful.  I didn't have to do too many preparation because of the confidence that my parents gave me.  Ah, the name of the school that I went to, on Wikipedia, it's National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents.  So we had to do an exam, somewhat like an SAT, in fifth grade.  And we would get into these schools and it was very hard to balance school and chess.  And that's around the time that I stopped playing music and I stopped giving concerts and just started to focus on school and chess.


((WN))  Who inspires you in chess?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I really liked the three sisters of Polgár, 'specially Judit.  Just because she kept on going and she didn't just want to be the best female chess player.  She was in top 10.  She was one of the first to break the barriers of gender, especially in chess society.  So yeah, she would be.


((WN))  Tell me about your most memorable tournament.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  She [Judit Polgár] played so many.  She hasn't been playing much in [the] past few years because she is focused on family, which I also respect a lot because I am a big family-person myself, so I completely understand that.  Her most memorable, it's really hard to pick.  She played so many high class tournaments.


((WN))  I meant your most memorable.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Oh.  My.  I want to go with my first time, the first tournament that I won.  The Iranian National Championship for girls Under-8.  Because that was one of the changing moments and I remember I wore like a princess dress and a tiara because it felt like a very powerful time for me.


((WN))  What is your favourite game?  Could be yours, or could be someone else's.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Favourite game.  Um, I play a lot of online chess and lot of good positions and good tactics happens there but I don't really know the name of the opponents.


((WN))  Tell me about the challenges you had faced as a chess prodigy living in Iran.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well one of the big challenges was that there weren't enough tournaments.  Because in Iran, women are seen as second-class citizens,  so, I wasn't allowed, and women weren't allowed to play, in open tournaments.  And there weren't enough women chess players to organise a big event.  And so when I was growing up and I was eight, we started — my parents started to request that okay, she is a good child, she should be able to play in male-based tournaments, basically.  And they weren't even female tournaments, they were just tournaments.  And so when I was eight, and when I was ten, they allowed the children, like the girl childs to play, which was kind of awkward.  And then they came up with more flexible rules, like if you are in the national team, you can play whatever tournament you want, if you win your category.  But still.  It was very sexist.


((WN))  You mentioned you were a TV anchor as a kid.  Tell us more about that.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Oh, so, one day I was singing and dancing in a mall, just, I don't know why, I liked that, when I was two.  And a TV producer saw me and really liked my confidence.  So they gave me the opportunity to co-host a TV show for kids.  And to try [to] inspire and motivate them to read and write to do other activities.  And I did that up until I was six years old, a little over two months and I was six.  And I quit because they wanted me to change the way I was dressing and start wearing hijab and start not wearing dresses and stuff.  And I thought that was stupid.  So I didn't go anymore and my parents fully supported my decision to stop the co-hosting.


((WN))  You also learned to read at a very young age.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yep.  Yeah that was all due to my parents.  They were very persistent with my education.


((WN))  How was your personality like, in your childhood?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Oh, my mom sometimes makes fun that I was like a child robot, that I was always saying what I was thinking.  And I was always very confident and just talking and trying to, I quote, she said, ""boss people around"" — as a two-year-old, which was kind of adorable. [laughs]  But I was always very competitive and, yeah: that was something that my parents gave me.  My parents [... to] have that potential to want to inspire other people.


Having won multiple tournaments as a kid, IM Dorsa Derakhshani decided not to play for the Iranian Chess Federation saying ""it wasn't a good fit"" for her.


((WN))  Early in your life you had decided you didn't want to play for Iran.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yep.  I made that decision around [...] two-thousand, so 2011, 12, 13, 14 were the years that I won Asia National Championships and Youth National Championships.  And I just didn't really fit with any of the teammates or any of the people from my federation.  And they all expected so much time and energy to try and, for the lack of better words, kiss their asses.  I just don't have a better word to put there.  And so I refused to do that because I was busy with school and busy with chess, and I refused to go there and sit and have weekly meetings about I don't even know what, not chess-related.  So it wasn't a good fit for me.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  And I was looking for immigration even before that because most of my family lives outside of Iran.  Not my immediate family but my aunts and cousins from both of my parents' sides.  So we were looking for immigration from early on, but I wanted to see if I could grow as a chess player within chess in Iranian Chess Federation but, when I was sure that it was not a good fit, is when I started to look for another federation and decided not to play for Iran anymore.  And the last time I officially played for Iran in an official tournament was 2015.  And in 2016, I immigrated to Spain to see if that federation and country would be a good fit for to live in and play chess for.  But when I was trying to make a decision if I should transfer my federation to Spain or stay with Iran, I received scholarship offers from US colleges and I decided to immigrate here and play for US federation.


((WN))  If Iran did not impose the compulsory observation of the headscarf, would you have, in that case, chosen to play for Iran?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I don't think it was about the headscarf because that's just a piece of clothing.  I mean, every job has a dress-code.  So it wasn't just about the headscarf, it was more about the way the society viewed women and how hard I as a woman had to fight.  I had to work like ten times harder than a man just to be seen as half as good as him, while I understood more and it should have been different.  It should — I mean the women face inequality in so many places but I decided instead of fighting in a country where I wouldn't have enough voice, I would immigrate to another country where I would have a better voice and a better future.


((WN))  Back then, did your younger brother Borna also decide not to play for Iran?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  He also wanted to immigrate, but he wanted to see which country.  He wasn't sure — Because my family still do have a pending immigration case to come to the US.  So he wasn't sure if he would want to wait until after immigration to start playing for the US, or he would want to play for a European Federation.  But since he is going to boarding school in UK, he switched his federation very quickly.


((WN))  When did you inform the Iranian Chess Federation about your decision?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Early 2016.  Because they wanted me to play different tournaments for them, team tournaments.  Because I would be their solid second board because I was Women Grand Master and then International Master in 2016.  So they wanted me to represent their country.  And I flat completely refused and I said that I'm in Spain and I'm working to transfer federations and I don't want to play for Iran anymore.  So I was in, for example, in 2016 [chess] Olympiad in Baku, I refused to play for Iran National Team and I chose to work as press for the French Chess websites.  And I was there.  I just didn't play for the team.  I went there on my own and I met with my family.


((WN))  So how long did you represent Iran at the chess tournaments?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, I stopped representing them in 2015.  And, well, I did play in an international tournament in 2006.  So I played World Youths in 2006, so I would say nine years?  Less that ten years, yeah.


((WN))  Had the federation ever warned you to cover your hair?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, I quote, they said ""Even if you are not wearing the headscarf, like on your head, at least have it around your neck"", and I just thought that was extremely stupid because they [the Iranian Chess Federation] wanted this to cover their asses.  So if there was a picture, they would say, ""Oh, it [the head covering] just fell"".  And it was like, if I don't believe in something, why would I bother faking it?  And that whole idea of, like, ""put the scarf around your neck and if somebody sees, just, like, put it up, put it down"".  That was extremely stupid.  But that's something that other female chess players in the team have been doing for years.  And most of them have already immigrated out of Iran anyways.


((WN))  Were there any other regulations [Iranian] female chess players had to adhere to?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Oh yeah, well the classic ""no parties"", ""no alcohol"", ""no contact with men"", blah blah blah, which we all broke anyways, but.


((WN))  After deciding you won't play for Iran, what did you do?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I, in 2015 I was trying to figure out which federation to go, which country to represent.  Switzerland was one of my choices.  But it [fell] through just because — it was very complicated.  I did want to represent the country of Switzerland, and they did want me to represent them.  So I would be their highest female [rated player].  I would be their board one.  But it was really hard to fit a good educational system for me and I didn't speak other languages besides English and I needed to be able to speak German or French or something else in Switzerland to be able to live and that was a big problem for me.  So I ended up moving to Spain and seeing if that would be the country I would keep living in and I only lived there for a year before I decided to move to US.


((WN))  How was your time in Montcada Chess Club?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Very nice.  They were very nice people.  They helped with a lot of things.  They helped me find a place.  They helped me find good tournaments.  They had good tournaments themselves.  I think one of the big tournaments didn't happen last year, but hopefully it will happen this year.  Yeah, it was a very growing chess club.


((WN))  After immigrating to the US, have you been to Spain again?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  No I haven't had the chance because mainly I am very busy with studying because I am pre-med student and the other problem was that I didn't have my green card at the time.  I got my green card last summer.  And I went to South America for a tournament: Panama.  I also went to Munich for the TEDx talk last summer, and no I haven't been to Spain.


((WN))  Tell me about your success at the Iranian National Youth under-8 tournament.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I don't really remember much from the games.  But I do remember I scored eight wins and one loss.  And that's how I won the tournament.  I didn't really have a coach while the other girls did.  And I don't really remember anything else besides the closing ceremony and how much I scored.


((WN))  Tell us about your participation in the Asian Junior Championships.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  That's actually around the time I started to think of chess as more possible career.  So the first, 2011, was in Philippines.  I got the first runner-up.  Second one was 2012 in Sri Lanka, I believe.  Yeah.  And I won that one.  The third one was in Iran.  Yeah, in 2013.  I won that.  '14 was in India: New Delhi.  After I won that, I just didn't play in the Asian Championship in 2015 anymore, just because I kind of won it a few times already.


((WN))  Were you supposed to observe the regulations of Iranian Chess Federation at the Asian Junior Championships as well?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yeah, because those were the years that I was trying to figure out if this lifestyle is for me or not.  So, yeah.


((WN))  What are some of your career highlights?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  One of the big things that I actually realised yesterday when I was reading another article was: in 2016, I got my FIDE trainer title.  And even to this date, I am the youngest FIDE trainer in the world which is kind of cool, because that was like four years, almost four years ago.  I received the titles of Woman Grand Master and International Master in 2016.  2016 was a big year.  And I won so many [...] prizes in international tournaments.  I played for different leagues, European Leagues, such as Switzerland, Belgium, Spain.  And I am a part of the British League.  I just don't really think it is safe to travel right now, otherwise I would be playing for tournaments.  Ah, let's see, I did play in US [Chess] Championship 2018 and I will be playing in US [Chess] Championship this year, but it has been postponed because of the [COVID-19] pandemic.  But I am supposed to play in it when we know the dates, anyways.  I think those are some of the ones that I run over just right now.


((WN))  What is your strategy while playing against players rated 2500+ points?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  It really depends on the colour and the preparation that I do.  But I usually just try to play solid and wait for opponent's mistakes while trying to put my pieces in the best places possible.  So that's something that I do regardless of who I'm playing.  But the opening preparations might change depending on the opponent's rating.


((WN))  How has your strategy and game improved over the years?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, my endgame is really improved when I started to read Mark Dvoretsky's books.  And, those really helped.  But I still have a long way to go to feel completely confident in my endgame skills.


((WN))  What is the opening you prefer?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I really do like to play against French Defence.  Just I've always had a pleasant position and I just have so much space and it really fits with my style.  So yeah, I really like to play against French Defence.


((WN))  And which chess opening you really don't like?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  When I am black and they play something like Catalan against me because it is such a boring and without-any-soul position.  I can't really get that creative and everything is just, well sitting and waiting, basically.


((WN))  Who is the toughest opponent you ever faced?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  It's kind of hard to say, let me keep thinking for a little.  I played the Muzychuk sisters Anna and Mariya in a round-robin tournament in late 2016.  They were, I think they were one of the toughest ones.


((WN))  Do you prefer over-the-board games or Internet chess?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  A mix of both.


((WN))  Which time control do you prefer?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Standard.


((WN))  How do you prepare for a tournament?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))    It kind of depends.  Because sometimes the tournament is really, the one thing I try to do is to match my time.  So for example, US Championship is going to be held everyday at 1 pm sharp, so I try to do lot of trainings at 1 pm.  Just because I want my brain to be prepared for that 1 pm chess-time instead of 1 pm nap-time.  So I think that's one of the big things that I always try to do.  If I have an important tournament and if I have the chance on the time to prepare for some of the physical and mental habits like this, I try to always do those.  I also try to find a coach that I am comfortable with, and who has enough time for me, and just figure out my issues and try to fix them.  Like if there is an opening issue, endgame issue, just something that I am missing about how to be better in chess.


((WN))  What do you think of the prevalence of chess engines?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  They're good but I think it's kind of also disturbing to some extent because when you are analysing a line, you don't use your own brain as much anymore and you just rely on the computer's brain.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing but it just kind of takes away the beauty of putting your brain to work.


((WN))  What do you think is the future of chess?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  It's kind of hard to say.  I'm hoping that — I have a lot of different suggestions from different Grand Masters and Women Grand Masters about the fact that in FIDE's rules there is a difference between woman title and open titles and not everybody is a big fan of that.  And we were having a discussion just in the kitchen at the Saint Louis Chess Club with the other Grand Masters about the pros and cons and they were saying that, as pros, some of the women in developing countries when they achieve the titles, that is like a really huge deal for them even though it is a woman title and it doesn't make sense to call something like a Woman Title and another Open Title.  So there are a lot of controversies going around, so that as a pro that these women are being helped because they achieved the title.  And another con is that, well, this doesn't feel right.  It seems you are telling women that you are only good enough for women titles and that's — it's really wrong because it creates the ideas that men think better, men make better decisions, blah blah blah.  I talked a lot in my TEDx talk last summer, that that's not true and this is just something that we have been told by society and by history.  And that is something we should work to change but I hope that chess society will be able to come up with better ideas 'cause if I had an idea about what to do about chess society, I would find the right person to pitch it to, I just don't, right now.  But I know there is a problem, I just don't have a solution for it.


((WN))  Which current players influence you the most?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I am a big fan of both Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana because there are both really great chess players.  And Fabiano Caruana, he does live in Saint Louis, so I know him more than I know Magnus Carlsen.  And their personalities: like how different their personalities are and again, and at the same time, how they both are number 1 and 2 in chess and they're both the best players of this generation.  That's something really interesting to me: not just their game, but how they think, and how they behave and, yeah.  I tend to analyse people which gets me in trouble sometimes. [laughs]


((WN))  Who is your favourite opponent?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  My favourite opponent?  My brother.


((WN))  How is he doing by the way?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  He is good.  He helped me install an anti-virus on my laptop yesterday, so, kudos for that!


((WN))  He is in England right now, right?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yes.


((WN))  Okay, tell me about the Gibraltar Chess Tournament.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  It was a really good tournament.  I played very well.  There was just one game where I could have played better.  But I had very good results.  I was drawing higher-rated Grand Masters and I was winning the lower-rated opponents, and I had a very nice tournament.  It was a very high-class tournament and the organisers were super nice.  And I was there with my mom and my brother, which made it even more nice.  What else?  I just really liked the atmosphere.  I would like to go back and play again when I get some chance, but unfortunately, it's been during my exam every single year so far.  But yeah, it went very smoothly.  I played very well, I really liked it.  It was just really great.


((WN))  Were you satisfied with your performance in the tournament?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I feel like I could have done a little bit better, but yeah, overall I was, I played very well, and I really liked it.


((WN))  But it appears [as if] more happened in the media outside the tournament


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Oh yeah.  Yeah, well, that's been kind of... interesting.  Well, it wasn't right after that.  It was, I played another tournament in Portugal right after, which I got sick during and I couldn't really play to my best.  But I did get the best woman, anyways.  Anyways, after that, I went for a vacation for about a week.  And after that I went to play in tournaments in Austria right after.  And that's when, I remember I didn't have Internet connection for a few hours because I was in a train ride from [...] I don't remember, a city in Germany to Austria.  And during that time, during that hours I was offline, the whole hell broke lose.  Well, yeah it did.  And my phone started to blow up when I got Internet connection again.  Just with Instagram followers and my friends messaging me where am I, if I were in Iran, if I am in Iran I should get out, and I was like, I am not in Iran, I haven't been back in Iran since I moved out in 2016 to live in Spain.  But okay, I am not there and I start to follow news.  And the next morning, my mom and my brother got to the hotel that we were staying at.  And I explained to them what was going on and we were all extremely shocked.  Because it's the timing of it, was extremely suspicious.  Because the tournament [Gibraltar] happened weeks before and I was a resident of another country for more than six months.  So the timing of it was extremely suspicious because the Women World [Chess] Championship was happening in Iran at that time, and all of the Iranian female players who were playing in that tournament got eliminated and the Federation was under huge scrutiny from the Iranian government and the people.  And they were like, ""Well, if you don't have good enough players to actually win this thing, why did you host it and why did you make us spend so much money on it?""  And because a lot of the best women chess players in the world refused to play in that tournament because of their values.  And they didn't want to go to a country where they are required to have a certain dress code and they wanted to be comfortable when they were playing the tournament.  So that was a whole big mess.  And when the story about me broke out that I was not wearing a scarf and I was representing, whatever they were saying, all of the attention shifted to me and my brother instead of the Iranian Chess Federation mistakes in hosting the tournament.


((WN))  You weren't living in Iran at that time.  You weren't representing Iran.  You had made it very clear you didn't want to play for the federation.  And yet they decide to sensationalise this banning of yours?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yep.  That's why it was very idiotic and seemed more conspiracy rather than they actually were offended by my actions.  Because they knew I weren't there.  They knew I was living in another country and looking to change federations and I've told them that I won't be representing them in official tournaments any more and the whole thing was very idiotic.  And more like a trying for a distraction rather than being actually offended.  Because if they were actually offended, I would have probably understood that, I guess?  But they weren't, because there was no reason to be offended.  I wasn't in the country, I was a resident of another country and that was very interesting the way they dealt with it.  And the fun fact is that if I was actually in Iran when the news broke, I would most likely still be in jail for I don't know what.  So even if I was the resident of another country, citizen of another country, because the laws in Iran don't really follow much of human rights.  Yeah, most likely I would still be rotting somewhere.  Yeah.


((WN))  How did you cope with that?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  With the fact that I would never go back to the country I was from?  I kind of expected that anyways, because I am against the government and everything it represents.  I don't have enough power to speak up to more authorities and do much.  So I just decided to leave the toxic environment.  And to live in somewhere that I'm respected for my beliefs and my values rather than being told to shut up and just deal with [the world] as it is.  So I didn't like living in Iran because of the Government anyways.  So I was okay with my never going back when I moved out to go live in Spain.  But, yeah, I still miss it.  I still have dreams about my home and a lot of the places in Iran that I went to.  But I accepted that I am never going back.


((WN))  How did you parents react to this?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  My mom is a huge planner.  So she had planned for something to happen because she always likes to have a plan A, B, C, D, be like just continuous — she is a huge planner.  And so she had somewhat prepared for the media scrutiny.  And we decided not to give any interviews, because we didn't know at the time what was going to happen.  My brother hasn't completed his immigration for his boarding school at that time.  He was still working on it.  And they probably realised that, all right, I was living in Spain anyways, so I would just live the life as I had.  And staying focused on finalising my brother's immigration process.  And we all decided to talk to one media at that [time]: chess.com.  And I told that I am not ready to talk anything political, I want to be respectful and I want to just tell my side of the story.  And they said they really liked that I agreed to just talk to someone.  But after a few months, I was ready to talk about the political aspects of things.  And I felt that I understood that more.  So I wrote a piece for The New York Times and I talked to more media outlets about this whole thing.


((WN))  Did the Iranian chess players reach out to support you?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Very very few.  And that was something that I expected to be more.  Because all of my high school friends, actually most of my high school, just the class that I had: they reached out and they have a group chat and they were really supportive, my high school friends.  But from the chess players, I think, Iranian Chess players, very few, maybe not even five or ten reached out to show their support which was very shocking to me.


((WN))  Your younger brother was also banned by the [Iranian] Chess Federation at the same tournament, playing against an Israeli Grand Master.  He was fourteen.  He was just a kid.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yeah.  They keep making a big deal about playing against Israel.  But the funny thing is that that tournament was in 2017 but in 2015, we both played against Israel in another tournament and nobody seemed to care, in the old tournament.  I don't understand why they make it such a big deal.  I understand that they don't recognise Israel as a country, which is super idiotic to me but anyways.  And just because they don't recognise it, they want to pretend that it doesn't exist.  So we are not supposed to play with it.  Something like that.  Which just doesn't make any logical sense.


((WN))  I just feel he shouldn't have been dragged into this [situation].


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yeah.  That's completely true.  He shouldn't have.  Because they just wanted a story and, well, the thing is that the first interviewer who talked to the [Iranian] Chess Federation's president, he questioned about my brother first.  And then put me in as ""And her sister also doesn't wear a scarf"".  But my story became more popular because it was something more relatable to the people outside of chess.  Because just playing with Israel doesn't really make much sense why is a big deal to other, to foreign people rather than not being banned for not wearing scarf.  But yeah, they made a big deal about him first, and then me, in Iran, in the interview that they had.


((WN))  Do organisers of the chess tournaments take measures not to pair Israeli players against Iranians?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  They used to, but, they stopped that since —. Yeah, they used to, and they used to call it ""forbidden pairing"".  But I think in about a year or two ago, when one of the Iranian chess players refused to play [against Israeli player] and when he went back to Iran, he became like a national hero.  He didn't win the tournament.  He didn't really do anything.  He just refused to play against an opponent which is very wrong in any sportsmanship manner, but anyways.  He became a national hero.  He scored a lot of financial and media attention.  He met with like the Iranian Government.  Yeah, it was like, just because he didn't play, he gained so much from it.  And so that's something that the FIDE refused to play by anymore and they, FIDE, made this rule that, yup, you can't play, we are not going to help you with your not playing against the opponent and then going back to your country and scoring all this financial, and attention.


((WN))  In 2016, in a Swiss Chess tournament at Basel, Iranian Grand Master Ehasn Ghaem-Maghami refused to play against an [Israeli] player.  Do you remember that?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yeah, I was there.  I was playing the same tournament.  From what I remember, he faked showing up late.  He showed up few minutes after the time control has already made the opponent win by time and pretended he was late for whatever reason and, blah-blah.  They tend to fake illnesses and get some doctor notes.  And that's what they did, some of the boys did in World Junior Championship.  And, yeah, it's an ugly situation.  Because for the players, it's a lose-lose.  If you don't play, you won't be respected as a chess player in the chess society.  But if you do play, you'd be under huge scrutiny from the country; the government.  So it's a lose-lose.  And that's, from what I understood that was one of the deal breakers for [Alireza] Firouzja and that's why one of the reasons that he immigrated and stopped representing Iran as well.


((WN))  I must say, on Lichess he [Alireza Firouzja] has been terrific.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yeah!  I have seen him playing a lot of online tournaments and streaming and he's very cool, I'm very glad for the kid.


((WN))  Does your family still live in Tehran?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  My family, yeah.  They still do.


((WN))  What are the things you miss the most about living in Tehran?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  The food.  I really really really like Persian food and it is kind of really hard to find it here.  And I miss my mother's home-cooked meals rather than restaurants.  And she can't just ship me food.  It would be awesome if she could.  [laughs]  Um, what else?  I really like spending time with family and friends.  Which, right now, everything is just online.  So.  I still do have some connections.  But.


((WN))  Why did you choose to leave Spain, and what would you have done if you hadn't received the scholarship?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, I really knew that I would continue in education, 'cause I didn't want to play chess and not go to university.  I wanted to have an option.  But I didn't want to play chess because I didn't have options.  That is a big thing for me: I wanted to have gone to college and have a degree and see if I want to pursue a career out of chess or to choose chess.  So I wanted to have that choice.  So I was looking into going to universities in US anyways, and before I did my SATs, I talked to two different universities: Saint Louis University [SLU] and UTT [University of Texas at Tyler].  And they both offered very great scholarships.  And the one factor that I, kind of like made my decision was the summer housing.  Because I wouldn't have anywhere to go and live.  I don't have the luxury of going back to my family for a summer.  And I just hated the idea of every summer having to find a friend and just like being living with someone for three months.  So SLU offered to cover the summer housing and I would be on campus dorms — apartments — and that was the big decisive factor for me.


((WN))  Did the Iranian Government cause any trouble when you accepted the scholarship or decided to play for the US Chess Federation?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  No.  No; well, they didn't really have a say in this switching the federation part, specially because I talked to FIDE.  I emailed FIDE and I informed that I would like to switch federations without Iranian being involved because they already disrespected me enough and I don't want to have to face them and FIDE agreed.  And I simply switched federations first to FIDE, and then from FIDE to US.


((WN))  Previously you had mentioned, ""no federation is perfect"".  Is there anything that Iranian Chess Federation gets right?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, I think you are referring to the interview, that video interview that I had in Baku.  Well, I wasn't ready to talk realistically about the Iranian Federation and I didn't want to be disrespectful because at the time, they hadn't disrespected me.  And I wanted to keep decent relations with them.  And that's why I said ""no federation is perfect"".  I was hoping that someone would read between the lines and see that I am not happy with the federation.


((WN))  How was the federation in treating their athletes?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, not very good.  Most of the student athletes didn't really have financial support or coaches.  So it was just like you were basically on your own.  And there was some help to send people to tournaments but it was no where nearly enough to see who has what potential.


((WN))  Should elementary schools teach and encourage students to play chess?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yes, definitely.


((WN))  And what are some of the advantages in doing that?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  One of the biggest things is that you learn to plan.  You learn to strategise.  You learn to think ahead.  And I think that those are some of the basic things you learn from chess.  If you want to win at any game in chess, you need to be able to have confidence to actually mate your opponent.  You need to have time management.  And you need to be able to strategise and plan ahead, see what you opponent want to do.


((WN))  What are some of the chess strategies you have applied in your real life?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Oh, this one I did say in my TEDx talk; I'm gonna use that.  I strategically manuevered and removed myself from the toxic environment of the Iranian Chess Federation and I moved to Spain and then US.  That was good strategic maneuvering.


((WN))  What is the one thing, other than chess, that you are an expert in?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  My cat.  I am very good with animals.


((WN))  What are the key things you learned living in Iran?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I learned to fight for what I want.  I learned that nothing actually comes easy.  You have to work for it.  And I learned that even though a lot of thing seem like basic human rights and logic, that's not how everybody sees it.  And those are some of the things I have been struggling to deal with here in college, because for most people: they are Americans, and their families are here.  And probably the most horrific thing that's happened to them was maybe they had to put a dog down.  Which is sad.  I understand.  But still, you can't compare that to not seeing your family for years, and not being able to go back to your country.  I feel like I'm like a hundred years older than the kids my age here.


((WN))  How has the atmosphere changed since moving to the United States?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I have learned, that it is okay to be myself.  I don't have to fake it to please people.  I hate being a people-pleaser.  I am still trying to adjust to how people see the world, because not everybody is always analysing and calculating things the way I am, because that's how I grew up.  And that's how I grew up doing chess.  And that's something I am still adjusting because sometimes it can be too much for my friends.  [laughs]  That I am always trying to see moves ahead of what they're going to do, what's going happen in their lives.  And, yeah, I can understand how that might not be a pleasant thing for my friends.  Because nobody like a smart-ass, so.


((WN))  How is life at the Saint Louis University?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I have a lot of great friends.  I really enjoy studying with them.  I really enjoy just meeting up with them.  And, I really like it here.


((WN))  How do you train these days?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, everything is online.  So we have been training and playing a lot of online games.


((WN))  Tell us about your team at the Saint Louis Chess Club.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, the chess club is slightly different than Saint Louis University's chess team.  Because the club and the team do collaborate, but the team is slightly different than the club. [...] For the first time last year, we had an all-girls team.  And that was very empowering to me.


((WN))  Who coaches you there?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Alejandro Ramírez.


((WN))  Well, how is it to have Alejandro Ramírez as your coach?  How is he in person?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  He is very friendly.  I was friends with him before I came to this college.  The year we played a tournament in Denmark, 2014.  And he was always a very nice person and always looking out for his friends.  And yeah, he was always very nice to everybody.


((WN))  How do your fellow teammates describe you as a person and as a player?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Everybody is quite respectful, but the ideas of gender-inequality do exist.  Mainly because they are not informed enough about the biology and how human biology actually works.  So I did receive questions about my TED talk and to me it seemed like they simply wanted to understand the topic more than criticise it.  So they had questions like ""But by statistics, men drive better, men are better in maths, men are better in chess"".  And I was like, so you are saying that men think better and make better decisions basically.  And, they were like ""I don't know enough about it, but it seems that way"".  And I was like, well, answer this question: If you are dying, if you are bleeding out and they take you to an emergency room and your doctor is a female, would you be like ""No no, I want a male doctor.  Female brain doesn't work as well.""  Well, you don't say that.  You are glad that the woman is there to fix you.  So if you can trust your life with a woman, why can't you trust a woman do think as good. [...] It is not about the gender who thinks better.  It is about each individual.  And they were very respectful to these topics.


((WN))  You had applied for the US citizenship.  Has it been approved?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yeah!  I got my green card last year.


((WN))  What is your major at the Saint Louis University?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I am double majoring in biology and clinical health sciences.


((WN))  How do you manage to train and participate in chess tournaments with ongoing academic curriculum?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well I haven't been able to participate in as many tournaments as I would want, because I have so many exams and different classes.  But I play as much as I can and the teachers are very cooperative.  Because they understand that I am a professional chess player and I need to, I kind of have to play.  It's like if I don't play then it's — well some of the team tournaments that we play also are university sponsored.  Well, most of the tournaments we play are university sponsored, so the teachers do their best to cooperate with that as well.


((WN))  What is the biggest decision you have made since moving to the US?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Biggest decision.  Wanting to be a surgeon.


((WN))  Have you participated in the Chess Olympiads?  And are you looking forward to participating in them?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I am looking forward to participating in them; I haven't represented any country because I didn't want to represent Iran, previously,  and I did tell you that I was there working as press in 2016, Baku Olympiad.  But I refused to participate for Iranian Federation.  But I hope that some day I will be able to represent US in Olympiads.


((WN))  Are there any advantages of playing for any federation?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  No.


((WN))  Apart from the Olympiads, I guess.


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, here I have better stability and it's more welcoming than Iran would ever be.


((WN))  Did the Iranian Chess Federation ever support you, back in the days?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yes.  They did send me to different tournaments.  And they did provide me with some coaching in 2012–13.


((WN))  How is the US Chess Federation different in that aspect?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, right now, I am more supported by the University and the Chess Club rather than the Federation as a whole.  But the US Federation has been always supportive of my decisions to speak up.


((WN))  How can the problems at Iranian Chess Federation be improved?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I don't think they can until [while] the government is the same, or, shares the same values and is unwilling to do the basic human rights.


((WN))  Tell me about the time you got the title ""International Master"".  And which title: Female Grand Master or International Master gave you more joy?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  So, I have received all of the female titles.  I started from Women Candidate Master, Women FIDE Master, Women International Master, Women Grand Master, and ultimately men International Master.  It was approved in Baku, the same 2016 Olympiad.  And it was very pleasant.  I expected it to be approved anyways, because that's just their normal routine.  But it was very nice because at that time, as soon as it got approved, as soon as I officially hold the titles, my family were in Baku at the same time.  So we went out, and we had a nice celebration.


((WN))  You had previously mentioned in your TED talk, you are curious about the human brain, and would like to study more about it.  How is that going to affect your chess career?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yep, that's true.  Well, I feel like the more information I have about how anything works, it helps me become a better human being.  And more mature, and I have seen the way I think about chess has changed compared to when I was, let's say eighteen, just because I am more mature right now and I am more honest to myself.  It's easier for me to see certain moves and certain patterns whereas when I was a teenager.  So I hope the more information I get anywhere helps me become a better human and better chess player.


((WN))  Are the gendered titles and segregated events bad in the long run?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I think so, yeah.  But at the same time, that is not a problem they can fix immediately, because if they take away all of the women titles, so many women will be harmed by that.  Because they are receiving benefits from their governments and from the chess federations.


((WN))  Earlier this year, Mitra Hejazipour an [Iranian] Female Grand Master in a tournament in Moscow: she chose not to wear [a] hijab.  Iranian Chess Federation President announced she was now banned from the Iranian Chess Team.  Iranian chess arbiter Shohreh Bayat decided not to return to the country after a photo of hers was circulated by the Iranian press in which her headscarf was not visible.  What do you think of this situation?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I mean, I am glad that they're finding their voice.  But they were not supportive when I found my voice.


((WN))  What was the President of the Iranian Chess Federation Mehrdad Pahlavanzadeh like?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  At the time I thought he was nice and genuine, but the more I got to know him, it felt like he was very power-hungry and a lot — really fake.  I just don't really have better words to put.


((WN))  Why does the federation take these actions instead of looking at the player's performance?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, the other problem is that they are under big scrutiny from the government because the government expects the women to behave a certain way and to dress a certain way.  So it's not just about what the federation thinks.  It's also a lot on the government.


((WN))  What message would you like to give to Iranian chess players?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Be true to yourself.  If this isn't the right fit for you, find the right fit.  And if you do believe and you are happy where you are, nobody should be able to tell you not to be happy and to disrespect your beliefs.


((WN))  Back in 2017, the World Rapid and Blitz Championship was held in Riyadh [in Saudi Arabia‍] and Israeli chess players were denied visa.  Iran hosted the 2017 Women's World Championship and it was boycotted by [WGM] Nazí Paikidze due to the mandatory hijab.  What is your say in organising events in these countries where players are either forced to adhere to a dress code, or denied visa altogether because of their nationality?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  That's very wrong to give tournament organisation to these countries.  They shouldn't do that.  Because these countries aren't following the basic human rights.  And we shouldn't support and encourage them to just keep treating women as they are, and giving them organisation, giving them publicity will just encourage that [what] they are doing is right which they aren't.


((WN))  Back in 2017, even [GM] Hikaru Nakamura tweeted, ""To organise a chess tournament in a country where basic human rights aren't valued is horrible. Chess is a game where all different sorts of people can come together, not a game in which people are divided because of their religion or country of origin.""


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Yes, I completely agree with that.


((WN))  Well, what are you favourite places to play chess?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Switzerland.


((WN))  What are you favourite chess books?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I really like the Mark Dvoretsky books.  I also really like the five books by Kasparov, My Great Predecessors.  Another book that I really like is My System.  A lot of people don't like it, and I probably wouldn't like it right now, but it was a huge deal for me when I first read it.  The way that they explain it and the way they inspired me to think was different than what I was doing.  So I learned a lot from it.


((WN))  What are your favourite non-chess books?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Non-chess books.  Um, I really like to read books by  [Atul Gawande], and he's a doctor here in the US who writes different books and explains how he felt on his experience, on his intake.  So I really like that.


((WN))  Who helped you get where you are today?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  My parents.


((WN))  What important truths do a very few people agree with?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))   I think one of the things that's kind of, people are still trying to learn is respecting everybody's beliefs.  Because people can be extremely judgemental.  I can be judgemental sometimes, and I have to talk myself and explain to myself that, okay —  people are allowed to do what they want and it is not my place to judge everybody.  And sometimes we all need that reminder.


((WN))  What do you do to relax when you are not playing chess?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I really like to watch TV shows, about different careers, 'cause I am never going to be a lawyer but just watching a law-related TV show helps me understand that aspects too.


((WN))  What according to you makes chess beautiful?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Sometimes it feels like chess is like you are hearing the music that the pieces are making and you're dancing, the pieces are dancing, to it.  And then you figure out a beautiful tactic.  I really like that analogy.


((WN))  What motivates you to play chess?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Well, I'd like to show people that you can do different things with your life.  And the idea that you can play chess and still study and still have a life outside of chess.  I think that's one of the big things for me.


((WN))  How much time do you spend behind analysing your own games?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Quite a lot actually.  It kind of depends on the game and ideally if I have the time, I would like to go back and talk to my brother or another chess friend.  And get their inputs.


((WN))  What advice do you have for new chess players?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  To figure out what they want and to find a book and find a coach who cares about them.  Well the book shouldn't care about the person, but the book should be able to speak to the person, because sometimes you just look at the books and look at the positions just because of the positions.  But sometimes when you are reading the book, you are actually feel that you understand this, and it is more than just a book to you.


((WN))  What are some of the bad traits that hold a player down?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Feeling like you are not good enough.  And feeling like your opponent is better than you, or, lot of these feelings that you are not good enough, you can't do it.  Because if you have any of these thoughts going into a chess game, you are not gonna come out it very happy.


((WN))  What is the best advice given to you?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  My mom, she always encouraged me to be true to be myself and to find the best way of expressing myself.  Because I went through a period when I was extremely straightforward with everybody and it was kind of hurtful.  Because I just didn't want to pretend anything.  I didn't want to fake anything.  And then my mom helps me realise that it is not about being straightforward or faking it.  It is actually finding the right words to put in, because sometimes what you say is hurtful but what you mean is not.  So that smooth transition between matching what you say and what you mean, I think that was one of the biggest advice I've got.


((WN))  In future what do you want to achieve in the game of chess?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  I would really like to be in US top five.  And I would also really like to be involved in chess as much as I can.  I do have my FIDE trainer title, and I would really like to be able to teach more kids.  I do have a few students and it seems to be going good, so far.  But I would like to understand better how to fix and help the players.


((WN))  Those were all the questions I had for you.  Is there something you would like to add?


((Dorsa Derakhshani))  Um, no I am good.  Thank you.

The move came after Sanders ended his own presidential bid last week.


In a live-streamed statement, Sanders said to Biden: ""Today, I am asking all Americans, I'm asking every Democrat, I'm asking every Independent, I'm asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse — to make certain that we defeat somebody who I believe — and I'm speaking just for myself now — is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country"".


In the 2016 United States presidential election, Sanders continued his bid against then-presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton for roughly two months longer, until June, and didn't endorse her until July.


Biden and Sanders announced they were to form six working groups relating to different policy fields. The groups are to cover health care, climate change, immigration, education, criminal justice, and the economy.

The move came shortly after fellow former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and former president Barack Obama announced their own support for Biden.


In a video message posted to Twitter, Warren commended Biden for his empathy towards US citizens and said she was ""proud to endorse Joe Biden as president of the United States."" Biden praised Warren's endorsement on Twitter, stating he was ""proud to have the fiercest of fighters"" on his side. He also expressed a desire to work with Warren to ""create a government that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.""


In Warren's campaign for the Democratic Party nomination, she was known for her anti-corruption stance and had released over 70 policy plans. However, she dropped out of the race in early March after failing to win any of the fourteen state nominating contests of ""Super Tuesday"", March 3. She did not immediately endorse another candidate at the time.

The coronavirus causes COVID-19, a sometimes-fatal disease. The milestone came a few weeks after the total number of infections worldwide surpassed one million on April 2.


The United States has the highest number of known infections, as of yesterday, with confirmed infections in the next highest country, Spain, totaling to around a quarter of a million.


The United States also has the highest number of deaths related to COVID-19, according to the JHU data; at least 55,000 deaths linked to COVID-19 in the United States as of yesterday, with the number rising by over one 1,000 deaths per day according to the Vox website. Italy, the country with the next highest number of COVID-19-related deaths, had around 27,000 as of yesterday.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Neuroscientists_tell_Wikinews_about_empathy_and_harm_aversion_observed_in_lab_rats,2020-04-30,Neuroscientists tell Wikinews about empathy and harm aversion observed in lab rats,"In findings published last month in the journal Current Biology, neuroscientists from the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience examined harm aversion in laboratory rats for conspecifics — rats not wanting to hurt other members of the same species — and reported which region of the brain was crucial for it.  Wikinews caught up with Dr Christian Keysers and Dr Valeria Gazzola, two of the authors who contributed to the paper.


For the experiment, the rats were put in a container with two levers.  The rats were trained to develop a preference for one of the two levers: each delivering one pellet of sucrose.  One of the two levers was harder to press.


After developing a preference, the preferred lever was wired to deliver a shock to another rat in a neighbouring compartment, while delivering a single pellet of sucrose.  The study showed the actor rat, which pressed the lever tend to switch the lever to avoid shocking the other rat.  The rat receiving the shock was called a victim rat.


Aversion of harm to fellow rats was reported to be equal in both male and female rats.  If the actor rats were previously exposed to the shocks, their degree of harm aversion for others was heightened, the study revealed.


The investigation reported the rats avoided pressing the preferred lever to shock another rat, even if that lever delivered two sucrose pellets and the no-harm lever delivered only one.  However, this was not the case when the rats were given three pellets by the shock lever.  Most of the actor rats did not switch when they received three pellets pressing the lever, which also delivered an electric shock.  Dr Gazzola called it a ""tipping point"" and said it was a ""cost-benefit"" function.


The study also revealed the importance of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) region of the rat's brain for harm aversion.  The scientists tested harm aversion for conspecifics in the rodents after deactivating the ACC using muscimol.  Muscimol was injected in the rats belonging to the test group, while saline water was injected to rats in the control group.  The observations showed without the active ACC due to muscimol, the active rats in the test group were no longer averse to harming the victim rats, but degree of harm aversion did not drop in the control group rats.


Thank you for agreeing for this discussion, by the way.


((Christian Keysers))  Um, hmm.  Our pleasure.


((WN))  So, I would like to discuss about the study, the observations you've made and what lies ahead to be discovered in this field.


((WN))  So, what prompted you, and your interest in studying about this harm aversion?


((Valeria Gazzola))  So half of the lab works on human research.  And half on animal research, right?  So, the main topic of the lab is really to try to discover the brain mechanism that allow us to be empathic, basically.  That's the main theme.  So in particular, from the human research what we are interested is really trying to see whether embodiment: so these processes that these brain regions have become reactivated when we see somebody else in pain, for instance.  You know, the regions normally involve[d] in [making] pain also reactivated when you observe somebody else [in pain].  Whether these, the activity of these regions is essential to motivate us for instance not to hurt other people.


((Valeria Gazzola))  And one of the biggest limitation[s] in particular of the human research is that you can go so far in understanding the brain mechanism.  Because we cannot, we don't have tools with the correct resolution in terms of, for instance, understanding what a single cell does, in these processes.  And that's why, for many years, we developed, we tried to develop a model in animals where all these techniques are more available that would allow us to investigate similar processes to those in humans.  So processes basically that are involved in perceiving the other['s] distress also in animals.  And, that's basically the main reasons why we move towards this research and then we started from coming up with the experiment in which we simply measure the distress of an animal in reaction to the distress of another.  Which what we call emotional contagion, for instance.  And we made it more and more complex in order to reach slowly a degree of complexity that can be comparable to processes in humans.  Emotional contagions: you can compare it, for instance, that the level of humans when you are in a crowd, or when you are baby, that as a crowd you are contaged by the emotions are around.  And, but then, we wanted to go a little bit of a step forward: okay now I am contaged, what does it mean to be contaged?  Can I use this information to, for instance, avoid hurting other people.  And that's how we came about, more or less, so.


((Christian Keysers))  I mean, one other motivation we have is that in the past we've also been interested in people that seemed to lack the aversion to harming others.  I mean, with that psychopath, sometimes they're called sociopath as well.  And so, a couple of years ago, we made this study in which we identified psychopathic criminals in high-security institutions.  We brought them to the lab, and we scanned their brains while they witnessed the pain of other individuals.  And what we saw was that if they don't have any particular reason to empathise with others, they really have reduced activity in their own pain regions while they witness the pain of others.  So, of course, that's interesting and it may suggest that perhaps, the reason why if they can make some money, for instance, they don't mind to harm other people is because they don't activate their own pain much while they witness the pain of others.  The problem like Valeria was saying, is that in humans we can see that the brain region is active while you see the pain of others, but you can't easily change the activity in the brain region to see whether that would change the way that the psychopathic criminal would act.  I mean, ideally, what we'd like to do is increase the activity of these pain regions in psychopaths and see that now suddenly they would really care to not harm others anymore.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Although it's not yet, it's also not yet very clear that we need activity of these regions to avoid the harm, right?  At that point, that's how we came about to run the experiment, because the first question was: is it really necessary.  The activity of these regions.  So, you start with okay, you want to manipulate these regions to reduce psychopathy.  But the field could not even prove that this activity was necessary to reduce harm.


((Christian Keysers))  And so, that was really one of the strong motivation behind the rodent-experiment, because rats have a very similar cingulate cortex to what humans have.  It is really a core part of the brain that is involved in feeling your own pain.  So, if you don't have a cingulate cortex and you hurt yourself, you still feel that you've cut yourself, but you don't mind.  And so you are not going to do a lot to avoid being cut again.  So this region exists also in the rats and it is a relatively deep brain region.  So therefore, we turn to the rats, and figure that in the rat, we can change the activity in the brain region and see whether that would then change how much the rat would be aversed to harming other rats or not.


((WN))  Could you briefly explain this study and its findings?


((Christian Keysers))  Ah.  So very briefly, what we do is we give a rat a choice between two levers that the rat can press.  Both of these levers will provide the rat with one little pellet of sugar which they really like.  So, they are happy to press these levers to get the reward.  In the main experiment, what we do is that one of the two levers is a little bit more difficult to press than the other one.  So most of the rats start to prefer the easy lever to press.


Now, as soon as they have developed the preference for the easy lever, what we do is that now, still both levers give one pellet of sucrose.  But now the preferred, the easy lever, also gives a shock to a rat that's in the compartment next door.  And so then, the rat that presses the lever not suddenly hears someone next door, kind of, in the protesting with the pain-squeak about the shock that he just got.  And what we see is that the, about a little bit less than half of the rats will now stop to use their preferred lever because it gives a shock to the other one, and they would start to press the harder lever to avoid to shock to the other rat.


Now after we found that, we could do is go to the cingulate cortex, which is the region that we saw was less active in the psychopathic criminal, and is normally active when you feel the pain of other people.  And what we saw was that when we deactivate this region with muscimol, which is a bit like a local anesthetic, which you can inject the part of the brain, now suddenly, the rats that continued to use their favourite lever even when it harms another rat.  So now, what we see in there mainly are kind of two big findings.  One is it shows us that humans are not the only animals that don't like to harm other animals.  Rat also do that.  And second is the fact that they use the same brain region, which is the cingulate cortex that humans use while they witness the pain of other people, as a necessary part of this harm aversion.


And the fact that it's the same brain region that we see to be active in humans tells us that in a way, it's not just the case that rats and humans have independently developed harm aversion.  It suggests that there is kind of a common ancestor that already had this ability, and that was then given to both the rats and the humans.  Which means that kind of harm aversion and not wanting to harm other people is at least 100 million years old, because that's more-or-less when our race separated from rodents like rats and mice.


((Valeria Gazzola))  And that also what we see is that there is variability in the responses of the observers, of the rats that make the choice between the levers.  And these variabilities also present in humans: when you do tasks that are rather similar, you see that not everyone acts socially, preferring the social lever.  But you also have individuals that would go for the reward more often.  So this is also another similarity between the animal world and the human world.  And on top of that,  I think that the other things we've learned from that experiment is that, the decision is a cost-benefit function, basically.  Because, we have a condition for instance where we increase the reward for the animal, for the observer.  And when you increase the reward, they are less willing to switch to the other lever.  So that also another similarity with human world and shows that maybe that it is a bit of complex, a tipping point, and it is like a function that really weighs the cost and the benefit of that particular context.


((Christian Keysers))  Because when Valeria says that we increase the reward, we increase the difference between the two levers.  So in the main experiment, the only difference is that one is harder to press than the other, but they both give one pellet.  Then in two other experiments, what we did was that now that two levers are equally hard to press; but one of them gives you two pellets, the other one just one pellet.  And then rats are still willing to switch away from the two-pellet to the one-pellet to save the other one from pain.  But when we made it three pellets versus one pellet, then, none of the rats were willing to give up the three pellets to prevent the shock to the other person.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Yeah, and then, the last, I think, result I kind of like in a way is that, as in many human studies, also in the animal world we did not find significant difference between sex.  So both, the female and the males acts in a similar way.  And in this type of paradigms, is also often the case in humans.


((Christian Keysers))  That's true.


((Valeria Gazzola))  So that's also interesting.


((WN))  What is the most fascinating aspect of this finding?


((Valeria Gazzola))  Well, in a way, I would say, to really show — I mean, I always believed it that animal performed these choices too.  And that they do it to a certain extent to at least care or at least perceive what goes on in the other, right.  It can't maybe specifically speaking of voluntarily care about others, but at least they perceive what goes on and I think this is something that the study shows pretty well that they do perceive, and that based on these perception[s], they make a decision.  And I think it is a complex — I mean, to me it was in a way trivial, because I always believed that, you know, if you are a ""social animal"", whether you are a rat, or a person, we are still animals, right?  They must develop behaviours that take advantage, or that they adapt to the fact that it's a social environment that involves more individuals.  But [...] the field keeps discussing, right?  Whether animals also have emotions, whether animals also can take this sort of decision.  And to see, slowly that evidence accumulates in favour of processes similar to what we call prosocial emotion or decision-making.  You know, similar: not exactly the same, but similar processes also are present in animals, to me is sort of reassuring also.  And I think it allows us to learn from how evolution evolved as well.  Maybe apart from knowing exactly how it works, but we start having some models where we can think, oh, evolutionary: maybe this process was already there, and then it developed further, more complex for the humans, but still is there to a certain extent.


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, and I think the fact that it's really the same brain region as well that seems to be involved kind of gives us some confidence that prosociality in caring about others is really deeply ingrained in our biology.


((WN))  What technologies were used to conduct this study?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah so in many ways it's a relatively simple study.  So we didn't need to use anything very high-tech in this case.  Because to alter brain activity, we use the injection of muscimol, which is a GABAA blocker.  It is a very simple pharmacological agent.  So it's really technologically a very simple study.  Nothing fancy.


((WN))  How did you get involved in this study?


((Valeria Gazzola))  Oh, we brainstormed about it.  We started, as I said, we did a lot of research on, since our early ages, let's say in all our scientific career is based on embodiment, and activities in these areas and slowly we kept wondering more and more, on the role of these areas.  And then, the way it goes, we normally speak about a topic and include other people and keep brainstorming, and I think, that's how it goes.  At least for us.  And in humans, we are also developing similar paradigms, so it just came one plus one equal to two. [laughs]


((WN))  What were the roles of other people involved in this study?


((Christian Keysers))  So, Julen Hernandez-Lallement, the first author of the study, was the one that basically made the vast majority of the experiments.  And he was helped by the other two: [Augustine Triumph] Attah: who did part of the other animal groups, and then Cindy [Pinhal] and Efe [Soyman] helped to analyse the data.  And basically Valeria and me have been kind of help designed this study initially and helped to analyse the data and wind up the study.  So we kind of lead the lab, but it's the other people that really manipulate the rats and do all the hard work.


((WN))  What was the timeline of this study?


((Valeria Gazzola))  Well, it was long.


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, I would say, four years?


((WN))  (Wow!)


((Valeria Gazzola))  Yeah, because the behavioural part is the longest one.  Because you need to understand the best way to teach the animal, first to manipulate the lever, then to manipulate two levers, and then, before the lever, there is also another action that they need to do; and everything needs to be done within a certain time.  So you need to let the animal the time to learn and for you that you run the experiment, you need to learn what's the best way, what's the best way to teach them to do the task?


Yeah, behavioural experiments of animals: they normally take quite some time to develop, specially more complex ones.


((WN))  Which activity took the most time and attention?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, I think that Valeria just said what's really important in these studies is to understand what kind of situation you can create for the rats that they are really understand and which they can in a way, show you what they're capable of.  So, kind of fine-tuning all the elements of the task, kind of how long do you let the rats develop the preference for one lever.  Because if you give them too much time to get too used to one lever, they are not so willing to switch anymore.  So the, most of the time is really involved in trying different versions of the paradigm, understanding what the rats really understand, and then analysing all the behaviour.


((WN))  What were the conditions did you test the hypothesis on?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah exactly; so the three kind of conditions we looked at was the hard vs the easy lever, and then seeing whether they switch to the harder lever when, to prevent the shock to the other one.  And we tried the two pellets versus one pellet and, then the three pellets versus one pellet.  And then finally, to test really whether the cingulate is necessary for that, we compare the condition in which we inhibit the activity in the cingulate using muscimol against the condition where we just inject salt water into the same brain region which doesn't have any effect.


((WN))  So, you mentioned the study took four years.  So you started back in 2016?


((Christian Keysers))  Correct.  Yeah.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Yeah, more or less.  I don't know the date.


((WN))  What was the most difficult part of this study in these four years?


((Valeria Gazzola))  I think it was really again the establishing the behaviour.  And in particular because we, at first — so the paradigm itself, we took it from a previous study, that was run years ago, do you remember?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, in '69, so that's kind of 50 years ago.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Fifty years years ago, so the idea of the two levers.  And so and at that time, the articles' level of detail were not so many.  The articles were not giving as much information as we now have to write down.  And so we had to guess some parameters over there.  And, the fact that the rats would prefer the easy lever was also not so straightforward.  So we thought ""oh, they are gonna prefer the easy lever, and that's it.""  But at the end, you know, some rats, some animals develop a preference on the side; like they prefer their right lever, or the left lever, or others, they prefer the heavy lever.  Right?  And that was also a bit puzzling at first.  We said, okay, so what do we do?  We find that a couple of rats prefer the hard lever, is that meaningful or not?  So we have to discuss a lot, how to adapt the paradigm to make it work, and this is also why we came about in using this switching index, because for our purposes, at the end, as long as the rat is able to switch a preference, right, whatever preference is developed is irrelevant, right?  And before the beginning of this study, we were more thinking: oh, they have to develop the preference for the easy lever.  And that's what is bringing us a bit out of the main purpose.  And we realised: okay, but, what preference they develop at the end, it doesn't matter as long as we have a preference that we can show they can change because of the shock.  So, I think this was one of the longest part[s], I would say.


((WN))  Were you anticipating this outcome?


((Christian Keysers))  Yes.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Yeah, I would say yes.


((Christian Keysers))  For once.


((Valeria Gazzola))  [laughs] Yeah, for once, yeah.  I mean, there was some evidence around and previous work was already bringing us towards that direction.  And, yeah, I mean we could not anticipate the proportion of animals that they would switch.  But, we surely were expecting the rats to switch.


((Christian Keysers))  We were hoping for the cingulate to be necessary, so.


((WN))  So what was your first reaction after confirming the hypothesis was true?


((Christian Keysers))  Jubilation.


((Valeria Gazzola))  We were happy.


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah.


((WN))  How many rats were used, roughly speaking, for this study?


((Christian Keysers))  I think it's written in the paper, but my guess would be something like, I'd say, 70.


((WN))  How distantly were the rats related to each other?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, so that's interesting, in this study we really find that there is a lot of variability between the rats.  So like I was mentioning, we have about 40% that were ready to switch when they witnessed other one getting shocked.  And about 60% that do not switch, so as a group, we really see that they do switch.  But then only a proportion of individuals really show that sensitivity, and others do not.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Or did you mean how close they were in terms of familiarity?


((WN))  I meant in kinship.  How genetically close they were?


((Christian Keysers))  So they're not genetically related.  They're not brothers or sisters.  And what we have is we have, we made one of the experiments with rats that didn't meet each other before, and it [the experiment] works.  And we had other cases in which they were living in the same home cage, and so they [would know] each other very well.  And the effect was not stronger.  So, amongst our rats, we really noticed that they care even about the fate of a stranger.


((WN))  So, if it fair to say there was no change in the degree of harm aversion when the actor and the victim were mates?


((Christian Keysers))  Correct.  Well, mates as in cage mates.  Yeah, there was no sign of a difference.  We did look at it and it was not the perfect comparison because the two groups were slightly different in the paradigm as well.  But, it didn't look like there was a big difference.


((WN))  So, do you think the degree of harm aversion would have been greater if the actor-victim shared some sort of kinship?


((Christian Keysers))  So we're actually going to test that very soon.  And it is up for grabs.  But in the past we've looked at whether a rat shows more freezing when it sees another one get a shock.  Which is a form of emotional contagion.  And there we compare a kind of rats from different strain,s even.  So one of the albino rats against a black and white rat, versus, that had never seen each other before, or ever seen a member of that strain, the one end.  And on the other end, really the rats have spent five weeks together and knew each other very well.  And we didn't see any difference there.  So I think the most robust findings is really that they care even about what happens to a stranger.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Yeah, we are testing it again now, in the future.


((Christian Keysers))  Exactly, specifically whether a mother would do more for her own kids than for...


((Valeria Gazzola))  Kids of somebody else.


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah.


((WN))  Well, that would go on to support Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene.


((Christian Keysers))  Correct.  Right.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Yeah.


((WN))  How was the functioning of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) deactivated in the rats?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, what you do is you place a cannula.  So you put the animal in a stereotact which is a system where you can go to a very specific position in the brain.  We place a cannula, which is like an injection needle just where we know the cingulate to be.  Then you let the animal recover with the cannula cemented in place.  Then, on the day of the experiment, you basically inject a little bit of muscimol, which is an agent that blocks neurotransmission.  Then by doing that, you can reduce the activity of the cingulate for about one hour.  And during that hour, you can make the experiment.  And then the control group is the same thing, but instead of injecting the muscimol, you inject some salt water.


((WN))  What are the affects of muscimol on the rat's body other than deactivating the cingulate?


((Christian Keysers))  Nothing really.  Because you inject a very small quantity, that should only spread about 1 mm in the brain.  So it really just affects the region that you — and you don't see any change in behaviour.  So we also tested, for instance, whether they move more or less, whether they press the levers quicker or slower, and there was no difference.  The only difference is that they didn't learn to not press the one [lever] that shocks the other.


((Valeria Gazzola))  And for instance, when you inject with muscimol, in case you see doing a normal fear conditioning paradigm.  So whether you are still shocked to the sound, and then you present the sound.  In that case, the rat behaves normally.  And it still freezes.  So, it does suggest that the muscimol effect is not impairing the normal behaviour, but specifically impairs the social behaviour of feeling...


((Christian Keysers))  ...of feeling for others.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Exactly.  That was also the interesting part of the ACC that we believe to contribute really, to including the other [animal] into your decision-making.  Because for a normal fear conditioning paradigm, you don't need to go through the ACC.  They are made to be self-sufficient.  But, if you do a fear conditioning basically that involves another individual instead of sound, like of pain, then you do need to go to the contribution of the ACC.  So there seems to be two slightly complementary pathway for fear-detection.


((WN))  After the effect of deactivating the ACC wore off, was the degree of harm aversion of the actors back to the previously observed level?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, that we didn't measure.  So, in that study, the muscimol animals were only in the behaviour with the ACC deactivated and the other ones were only with their ACC intact.  So, but this is something that we plan to test in the future as well.  To really see whether the ACC is necessary to acquire the aversion versus to maintain it.


((WN))  Okay.  So it is not a permanent loss of empathy.  Right?


((Christian Keysers))  We don't know, but I think there is no reason to assume that when the muscimol wears off, they would not become normal again, right?  So that's most likely.  What we don't know is whether if we had for instance, because there's three days of experiment, right, where we develop the aversion.  And what we didn't try is for instance, give muscimol on Day 1 and Day 2 and then stop it on Day 3, and see whether on Day 3, they would then suddenly stop using the lever that gives shocks on the other days.  So that we don't know whether it's necessary for learning or for recall; we just know that if you don't have it at all, you don't learn at all.


((WN))  Did any of the actor rats choose to switch when they were on muscimol, and their ACC was deactivated?  Did any one of them switch?


((Christian Keysers))  It's a good question.  I would need to look in the paper.  If you have the paper there, perhaps you can see it.  But I can have a quick look to see if I have the paper somewhere.  Yeah, so if you look at the Figure 4c, you can see the behaviour of each individual animal.  And what you will notice is that there are some animals like some of the red animals which are the muscimol group that did switch, but the majority didn't switch.  So I see there is one and only one animal in the muscimol group that really did switch.  But what happens is that when you make those experiments, you never know for sure that when you inject the muscimol, that it has the desired effect.  Because of course you have a cannula that's in the brain, and the cannula could become clogged also.  So it can be that that one animal switched because the muscimol wasn't effective for some reason.


((WN))  Did the team test the change in the degree of harm aversion when the actor rats were given psychoactive drugs?


((Christian Keysers))  No.


((Valeria Gazzola))  No.  Could be nice, but we didn't.


((Christian Keysers))  Exactly.  Yeah, and in particular, there is a drug called Ecstacy that you may have heard of.  So, some people reported that Ecstasy for instance, increases the feeling of empathy amongst humans.  And I think that there is somewhere a study suggesting that if you give that to animal, there is also an increase in the sensitivity to what happens in another animal.  So we didn't test that.


((WN))  Did you also conduct the test with only one lever delivering the food also the electric shocks: how far the rats were willing to starve before they chose the victim should suffer?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, no so we didn't do that.  That is a very old experiment from [Russell] Church.  I think in the 50s, he did that experiment kind of with rats and with monkeys.  And he sees that the rats will use the lever less.  So even if you just have one lever, they'll use it less if it causes pain to others.  But in monkeys, that was a very strong affect.  Some of the monkeys really would rather not eat anything than to shock another monkey.  So it's an interesting experiment, but we haven't done it.


((WN))  In that diagram, we can clearly see the difference between contingent harm of males is lesser as compared to the females.  Even though it is somewhat similar.


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, what you see here is the two lines: the dark green and the light green that represents the males and the females.  For harm aversion, for that you should look at how much it changes from the baseline through the three shock sessions.  And the change is exactly the same in males and females.  But the difference between the two curves that you see is the fact that the females started off with the higher preference than the males did.  But the reduction in preference is same across groups.


((WN))  Tell us more about the observed differences between these rats.


((Christian Keysers))  Between which rats?  Rats, you mean, in general in the experiment?


((WN))  In general, like the rats, which were on the extremes, how extreme were they on the case-by-case basis?


((Christian Keysers))  Well, that you can see, if you look at Figure 3b in particular, you can see that some examples on the top of 3b of rats that had started off with a very strong preference for that were around 100 on the baseline session.  And it stayed at 100.  So they absolutely didn't care at all.  And in the other case, if you look at the bottom panel, you have some animals that initially had a preference around kind of 80%.  And by Day 3, they really go down to 0% of the shock lever used.  So it's really a very substantial difference; some changes much as they possibly could and some don't change at all.


((WN))  What could be the possible reason for this?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, it's a good — if we knew that, we would be very happy.  I think the things that we did look at and didn't play major difference is actually the reaction of the demonstrator.  So the first thing we figured perhaps you have demonstrators that really squeak a lot, and others, that don't give a lot of pain signals, and that could could explain the difference.  Then we quantified the reaction of the demonstrators, we saw there were no major differences there.  Where we did see really, big differences is in the reaction of the observer.  So we saw that there is some observers for instance, when they realised that they had shocked the other one, they really stopped to do anything for a while, and took longer to go get their food and ate the food very quickly.  So they really showed that they were disturbed by these shocks.  And those were the ones that switched.  And then were other rats that didn't seem to mind at all, they just kept eating their food as if nothing had happened.  And those ones were the ones that didn't switch.  So we feel that there's really just a striking difference in how much attention as well the agent paid to the harm signals of the other person.


((Valeria Gazzola))  But the causes are not known.  The causes of these are not: could be different brain activity, it could be the relationship between the distress that the observer perceives from the other that stops them to do anything, or actually motivates the other.  I mean, there are a lot of factors that could play a role.  And we are trying to think of it: how to test and untangle this aspect apart.  But it is not easy, but it is definitely a topic we are interested in.


((WN))  How much do we know about the evolution of harm aversion?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, well we don't know that much.  So from a kind of biological point of view, kind of it's only over the past, I would say, 10-20 years, that evolutionary biology is really paying a lot of attention to kind of altruism and mutualism.  Because if you read kind of traditional and evolutionary kind of books, they underline the selfishness of individuals.  So the idea that you mainly need to survive yourself, and that other animals are really competitors.  And then more slowly, people started to say, ""well of course, you care about your kids, because they have a lot of your genes and therefore, that makes sense"".  And it's only quite recently that people start to really see that even if you are not really related to another animal, but kind of you help each other, your whole kind of herd or group ends up better-off.  And the individual ends up being better-off.  Because often, rats actually, or animals have a sense of mutualism.  So if someone was kind to you at some point, you're more likely to be helped by that person in the future.  So that helping others is a way to facilitate being helped by them in the future.  And so, it still is a relatively young field of research that really acknowledges the fact that kind of in social animals, that live in groups.  And individuals will really do things for others kind of and that this is beneficial for evolution.  So it's really only starting to be explored.


((WN))  Is the ACC responsible for harm aversion in other vertebrates too?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, so what we know is that for instance, in monkeys, the cingulate seems to be necessary as well to, for instance, decide to work, to give juice to someone else.  So, in the primates they have some paradigms where you see a symbol on the screen that means that if you now do something, there can be juice for yourself.  And a different symbol if you work will give juice to another monkey, and a third symbol if you work that one, there'll be juice that's delivered in an empty glass.  And what you see is that monkeys that really work hard for themselves, but they're also willing to work a little bit to give juice to another monkey.  And that's more than they are willing to work if the juice is just gonna get wasted in as glass.  And there as well, the ACC seems to be important to motivate the monkey to work for another monkey and that's the other example that we know.  In mice, there is some evidence that if you disrupt the cingulate, then the mouse will no longer freeze when it see[s] another one getting shocked.  But that's it.  As far as I know, there's no other animal that has been explored.


((WN))  Are there any ethical considerations around conducting this study?


((Christian Keysers))  Yes, of course!  So, we ourselves, of course do not particularly like to have to give shocks to one animal.  So the only reason we really do these experiments is that we feel that harm aversion is such an important phenomenon.  Because in human society, when people lack harm aversion, they really cause a lot of damage to society.  Both because they harm people, and they end up in prison and that has a huge cost; but as well for the fact that these individuals really erode trust and they harm in a way the interaction that all of us have with each other.  Because we are always afraid that the person we have in front of us might be someone that will take advantage of you and harm you.  So I think, in understanding how that works in the brain is really really important.  And because of that, we feel that it's important to really understand how it works.  And currently, working with animals is the only way that we can really modify brain activity and see if it changes behaviour.


((WN))  In future, might you test this hypothesis with different species?


((Christian Keysers))  Yes, we might do it in mice.  So, of course, for other people, rats and mice are pretty much the same thing, but kind of there is a difference between them.  And ultimately, we hope we can do this in humans.  But for that, we need techniques in which we can modify brain activity in deeper brain regions.


((Valeria Gazzola))  You can do it once in a while in patients that already suffer from epilepsy and normally the surgeons inserts electrodes to measure, to find out the source of epilepsy, and you can at times stimulate to see whether the region is essential in some of the normal behaviour.  So at times, you can have access to these patients and ask them to participate in our task and we have a couple of collaborations, that we hope that will help us to tell something more about the role of the ACC and the insula in these type of tasks.  And we are also currently trying to develop methods that are human-friendly, in the sense that they are not invasive, and to be used in active participants to try to disrupt the activity of these regions as well.  Nowadays it's not easy to do because the TMS that [is] normally used to simulate the brain in humans, the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, is not very well suited to reach deeper structure.  Like the ACC goes really inside and it's a bit curved as well.  You can reach with TMS, but it's not the cleanest way.  So we are also trying to see whether we can use, for instance, ultrasound stimulation to do it and test it directly in humans.  Of course, it will also make use of data that comes from patients that show damages in the ACC.  And it was a study from Ralph Adolphs in the past that did confirm that some of these regions like insula for instance, are important and essential for discriminating emotions for instance, so, you can also test in these patients: use our tasks and test these patients.  So there are bit, some ways, to do it in humans, but it's quite small so we are investing, but the results take longer.  And of course, when you use patients, you always have the problem of reorganisation of the brain structure that you are looking at, possibly, so.


((WN))  Is there a way to increase the degree of harm aversion in anti-social beings?


((Valeria Gazzola))  Yeah, that's the question we are really interested in, and we don't know.  And that's why we are interested in finding out whether a particular region like the ACC is necessary for the development, or for the behaviour to occur.  Because once we know, we can confirm that in humans as well, what you could think are several ways.  You can manipulate plasticity in that region, so, ask the participants to go do certain tasks where they learn something.  And while you are modifying for instance, the {w|neuroplasticity|plasticity}} of the brain with current or magnetic simulation.  Or you can think of targeted therapies, for instance like neurofeedback, when you project the activities of the areas where the participants doing a task and the participants can directly modify through visual feedback the activity of these areas coming up.  So that if I now project on the screen the activity, real-time, the activity of the particular regions, I can tell you ""okay, try find a way to modify that region"".  So you would come up with thinking of something, you know, it's just a random process, but you could come up with a task saying like, ""Okay, if I think of how my friend is feeling now, I see that manipulated region"".  And then you can practice and practice to the point that it becomes automatic kind of things and that activity of that region now is modified based on your exercise and your activity.


So there are ways that we hope we may be able to use in the future to see whether we can use, can maybe improve or help these people to care more about.  But again we need to identify not just the region that is involved, but also at what point of the decision-making is happening.  So is it the motivation that is lacking, is just the attention, or is the general level of activity of that area, I mean, we don't know yet.  What is the reason why harm is done or you don't care to the other.  And if you consider that these decisions are always or in most of the cases this balance between a cost and a benefit, what you need to do is we need to readjust the cost-benefit balance which complicates the thing a little bit more.  But that's the way we want to go but it's the future.  So you also have this ethical aspect like, so it depends what — if somebody, like, with psychopathy, is just in the tail of the normal distribution right, so it is not just the specific dysfunction, but it's just a normal variability that went to the extreme, right, then where would you put the line and say, ""Okay, now I intervene to change these and when I don't"".  Because we know that certain traits or certain aspects of psychopathy can be useful in society as well.  So, then it becomes an ethical problem of when do we actually intervene?  And do we want to intervene early in kids that already manifest aggressive behaviour, or do we need to let them experience it and then act later on.


So there are a lot of considerations before doing interventions on these topics.


((WN))  Are there any future plans to explore more on the harm aversion and its evolution?


((Valeria Gazzola))  Ah, yes there are a lot of plans and, roads, let's say.  One of the plans we have is to really understand a little bit even more in details what is happening in the brain, at the cellular level and which are the inputs of these neurons are involved, what type of neurons are involved and all these aspect[s], we are also interested in trying [to] understand the developmental curve, what is happening, for instance, if you are exposed to a very stressful life when you're young, what kind of consequence it has on harm aversion later in life.  And we are interested in seeing how it is also transmitted through generations, like if you have these variabilities between individuals, with some individuals having higher propensity to be prosocial, or whether, you know, you select individuals that are mostly prosocial, would this selection be brought forward in the next generation.  So we also want also to see how much is learned and how much is more genetically encoded.  So all these aspects, we are trying to tackle with different experiment.  And let's hope we — of course the other aspects are very early at this stage.


((WN))  What are the other research you are currently working on?


((Valeria Gazzola))  [laughs] You want them all?  No, okay, so as I mentioned from the animal's point-of-view, we are doing, we want to do electrophysiology on the, a bit more of the physiology, and up the genetic to discover the role of the ACC and each single cell of the ACC, as I mentioning before.  So, is it for instance, let's say, what type of cells is involved in mapping the other pain into my own pain.  And where the information comes from, so what is the circuit that is involved, and how the other things change the information: this is one aspect of one of the experiments we're gonna run.


In humans, for instance, we are also, we've been implementing a lot of learning paradigms, similar to the one in this paper where people are faced with two symbols: they have to understand what are the consequences of choosing one versus the other and one symbol most often brings you higher reward, monetary reward, but also you would also see the other be more in pain, and the other symbol is the opposite.  And we again want to understand whether the circuit that is involved is the same as we see in the animal and vice-versa.  And again, whether we would like to simulate some of the areas we find, to see how the causality between this particular brain activity and the behaviour.  And we are also curious to see whether it matters, whether you see the other person being in pain in front of you, for instance, compared to simply receiving a message that the other person is in pain.  Because we believe that the embodiment component mainly comes into play when you see the other person.  You can also recall some embodiment processes through text.  But whether there is a difference between the two, we don't know.  So we are also interested in that aspect, and also interested in differentiating whether when you encounter such a type of conflict, whether there is a negative consequence like pain vs money as a reward; whether you value the pain of the other similarly to how much you value the pain for yourself.


And this is just a glimpse on all the things we are are doing.  I would say, on this aspect.  We also are interested in experiments that are trying to see how [we] ourselves encode emotions, do we have cells that code for happiness and cells that code for pain, painfulness or sadness or the cells simply encode the negative and positive aspect towards how strong it is.  Independently of a specific emotion.  So these are also other questions we have.  Unless you want to mention more, but I think it is plenty.


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Yeah.


((WN))  What is your role at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience?


((Christian Keysers))  Yeah, so we basically are both of us department heads, so that means that we each have a a group of people we basically manage.  And of course we really work very very closely together.  So our two groups kind of together form what we call the Social Brain Lab which is basically investigating how our brain processes the emotions of others and reacts to them.


((WN))  Well, that were all the questions we had for you both.


((Christian Keysers))  Okay.  Very good.


((WN))  Is there something you would like to add?


((Christian Keysers))  No.


((Valeria Gazzola))  No, I think it was quite thorough.  Yeah.


((WN))  Thank you very much for agreeing for this [interview].  It was great pleasure discussing this with you.


((Christian Keysers))  You are welcome.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Thank you.


((Christian Keysers))  Thank you. B-bye.  Have a good day.


((WN))  Thank you.


((Valeria Gazzola))  Bye.


((WN))  Bye.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Philippines%27_largest_television_network_shut_down_by_government,2020-05-06,Philippines' largest television network shut down by government,"Following the expiry of broadcast corporation ABS-CBN's legislative franchise, the Philippine government issued a cease and desist order dated yesterday, forcing the shut-down of broadcasting operations by the company. Later in the evening, the network signed off and went off-air. The last time the Philippine government ordered the network to shut down was during the martial law imposed by former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos back in 1972.


Republic Act No. 3846, also known as the ""Radio Control Law"", states ""no person, firm, company, association, or corporation shall construct, install, establish, or operate a radio transmitting station, or radio receiving station used for commercial purposes, or a radio broadcasting station, without having first obtained a franchise therefor from the Congress of the Philippines."" Since ABS-CBN's legislative franchise, Republic Act No. 7966, expired on Monday, the network no longer had a valid franchise to continue airing their programs. The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a cease and desist order to the network yesterday, and in compliance, the network signed off that night.


The network tried to renew their franchise as early as July 2019, but all eleven of the legislative bills filed have been stuck in Congress. The franchise of ABS-CBN expired on Monday, the same day Congress reconvened after their Lenten Break, which began on March 13. Though the NTC is allowed to provide the network a provisional license while its application to the Congress is still being decided upon, the commission refused to provide the network with said license. A number of Senators condemned the act of the NTC, citing the move as a ""grave abuse of governmental power"" and ""contrary to law"".


ABS-CBN Corporation is the largest television and radio broadcasting company in the Philippines with over 42 television stations, 10 digital channels, and 18 FM and five AM radio stations, and has been broadcasting for over 65 years. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte threatened the network's franchise renewal before, after the network didn't carry some of his campaign commercials, which they've said was due to a lack of airtime, and he accused the network of ""swindling"". Solicitor General Jose Calida filed a quo warranto petition on February 10, accusing the network of violating its franchise. After a Senate hearing was conducted on February 24, the Senate did not find the network had breached laws, nor its franchise terms. ABS-CBN CEO Carlo Katigbak said refunds for Duterte's unaired political ads were offered, of which some were not accepted by his campaign. Katigbak apologized to Duterte during the hearing, which the President accepted according to a statement by the Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.


The network's news channel, ABS-CBN News Channel, is still on air, as the network claims the cease and desist order did not cover their news channel's franchise.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/US_Supreme_Court_overturns_fraud_convictions_in_Kelly_v._United_States,2020-05-08,US Supreme Court overturns fraud convictions in Kelly v. United States,"Yesterday, the United States Supreme Court overturned the criminal convictions of Bridget Anne Kelly and William Baroni for crimes relating to a 2013 incident involving allegedly politically motivated traffic chaos at a major bridge access from New Jersey to Manhattan. Kelly, then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's deputy chief of staff, and Baroni, then the deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were both previously convicted of fraud for their actions.


The case revolved around Kelly and Baroni's convictions following the 2013 ""Bridgegate scandal"" in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In September 2013, for four days, traffic ""ground to a halt"" — as the Supreme Court decision put it — at part of the George Washington Bridge, an entryway into Manhattan, administered by the Port Authority. For decades, three of the twelve access lanes to the bridge had been reserved during morning rush hour for commuters coming from the streets of Fort Lee. But on these four days only a single lane was set aside. The public officials who ordered that change claimed they were reducing the number of dedicated lanes to conduct a traffic study. The Supreme Court decision stated they did so for a political reason: to punish the mayor of Fort Lee for refusing to support the New Jersey Governor’s reelection bid.


The Supreme Court sought to determine whether Kelly and Baroni's actions qualified as property fraud under federal statutes. The unanimous court decided their actions did not qualify, reversing the convictions and remanding the case back to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.


Writing for the Court, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan declared in the majority opinion, ""not every corrupt act by state or local officials is a federal crime. Because the scheme here did not aim to obtain money or property, Baroni and Kelly could not have violated the federal-program fraud or wire fraud laws.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Astronomer_tells_Wikinews_about_discovery_of_closest_black_hole_known_so_far,2020-05-22,Astronomer tells Wikinews about discovery of closest black hole known so far,"A study published in journal Astronomy & Astrophysics last month reported astronomers from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and elsewhere discovered a black hole in the Telescopium constellation.  The study stated the black hole is about 1010 ± 195 light years (310 ± 60 parsec) away from the Solar System, meaning it is the nearest known black hole from the Earth.  The nearest previously known black hole — V616 Mon — the study noted was usually estimated at more than 3000 light years away.


The black hole described in the study is located in the HR 6819 stellar system of Telescopium constellation, making it the first system visible to the naked eye to contain a black hole.  HR 6819 contains two stars, and they are visible from the Southern Hemisphere.  The astronomers started observing the system in 1999.  Initially, they thought it was just a binary system, consisting of two stars.  However, upon examination, the researchers concluded there was a third unseen object in the system.  One of the two stars in the HR 6819 system is close to the black hole and orbits the black hole in just 40.333 ± 0.004 days.


This newly discovered black hole does not have an accretion disk.  A black hole forms an accretion disk when a significant amount of matter orbits the black hole, as depicted in the image.  Accretion disks often emit electromagnetic radiation.  Since this black hole does not have an accretion disk, researchers had to rely on the gravitational effect of the black hole on the nearby star in order to discover it.


Researchers used the binary mass function to conclude the black hole had a mass of at least 4.2 M☉ (Solar masses; 1 Solar mass = mass of the Sun).  Its companion star, which orbits the black hole in about 40 days, is classified as a B3 III star.  The outer star is classified as a Be star.  Be stars rotate very quickly around their axes.  Since the outer star rotates so rapidly, the star is not exactly spherical, but instead oblate, bulged at its equator, forming a gas disk around the equator.


The research suggested HR 6819 was very similar to another system LB-1.  The HR 6819 system is estimated to be between 15–75 million years old (myr).  The inner star has estimated mass of at least 6.3 ± 0.7 M☉.  Using the mass and the speed at which the inner star rotates, the researchers concluded the black hole had an estimated mass of 5.0 ± 0.4 M☉.  Researcher and co-author of the study Thomas Rivinius told Wikinews the inner star and the black hole are closer than the Sun and the Earth (1au; 150 million km; 93 million miles).


The researchers dedicated the paper to Stanislav Štefl, one of the fellow researchers who died in a car accident in 2014 in Santiago, Chile.


Wikinews caught up with Thomas Rivinius to discuss about this discovery.


Thank you agreeing for this discussion by the way.


((WN))  I would like to ask you about the discoveries that you and the team made.  And about the future investigations.


((Thomas Rivinius))   Ah, well yes, do you have any specific question?  I mean, the future investigation is to make sure that it really is a black hole and we will probably do that by means of Interferometry.  What we ultimately want to get is: you probably have seen the animation, it is a sequence of images that looks like this animation.  The two stars moving around: not around each other, but with a third object.


((WN))  What prompted your interest in astronomy?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Oh, astronomy in general.  That is very long.  You see, when I was maybe ten years old, I was already very interested in astronomy and started observing from backyard with a small telescope.  It's actually that got me into physics and mathematics, and then I studied physics.  There was a time I was not sure if I would end up in astronomy or particle physics or something else.  But in the end, I always decided to continue the astronomy path.


((WN))  Could you briefly explain this discovery and its findings?


((Thomas Rivinius))   Well, it is a long story indeed.  Because originally we thought it was a binary star — just two objects — not three.  And that would have been interesting because these two stars are similar in many senses.  Like they have a similar mass.  They are similarly old.  They are consequently of similar temperature, et cetera.  But in one aspect they are very different.  Namely, one is rotating very very fast.  It is a so-called Be star.  Which means it is rotating so fast that it is almost flying apart.  There's actually material flowing off the equator.  And the other is rotating rather slowly.


So the original investigation was to figure out why two stars, that are so similar — that must have formed together — why they would be they so different.  And now this is not something we could answer in the end because the distant system is of a different structure.  But instead we found that it is of a different structure and there are three objects, but only two of them visible.  And that means, if you put the data we get into Kepler's laws and Newton's laws about gravity and the rotation, you find that the third object must be very massive.  And if you don't see it but it is very massive, that means it cannot be a star.


((WN))  And that is how you concluded it was a black hole?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Yes.  How we concluded it's a black hole is we derive the mass from these Newton's and Kepler's laws.  And then we see if, given the quality of data we have, if it would be possible to detect the star with such a mass.  And we went through several options down to the faintest possible stars we could imagine, with such a mass, and there is no such object.  Our data is good enough that we would have seen such a thing.  And therefore, if it is not luminous, it must be a black hole.


((WN))  What drew the team's attention to this stellar system, HR 6819, in the Telescopium constellation?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Well in the first place, because it was in a catalogue of these extraordinarily rapidly rotating stars: the Be stars.  They are really so rapidly rotating that they are oblate.  They are not round, not spherical anymore, but they are oblate.  And they have a gas disk that is flowing off the equator because they rotate almost at critical [velocity].  And that is basically my research, in what is forming this.


((WN))  Why did the team start observing HR 6819 specifically?


((Thomas Rivinius))  As I said, because it's a Be star.  There are about 100–200 Be stars which are of that brightness.  And maybe 150 visible from the southern observatory of La Silla.  And so over the many years, we have taken, not all, but a fair fraction of them, and we started off with relatively few spectra, with only ten spectra.  And with this, we slowly sought our way through which are interesting and which are not and at some point, this [system HR 6819] did strike us interesting because we thought it was binary.


((WN))  And when did the research team start observing?


((Thomas Rivinius))  The first observations, these few spectra were taken 1999.  And the second set of spectra was taken 2004.


((WN))  What was the most fascinating aspect of this finding?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Well, for me, it's the realisation that  black holes are very common.  I mean, I knew the numbers: that you get about one black hole per thousand stars.  But that actually means there must be some black holes rather nearby.  And originally, you would expect most of them single, so that you would never find them, because they are very small, very black.  Nothing to see there.  But when they are in a multiple system, then you can see them through their gravitational influence on the other stars.  And, so that basically was, I think, the best finding, that it is a multiple system — a stable multiple system.  Many stars are in multiple systems.  But when a black hole is formed via  supernova, you would actually think that many of these systems get destroyed: disrupt[ed] by the explosion.  This did not happen.


((WN))  What technologies were used for this discovery?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Spectroscopy.  In other words, spectroscopy is a technology by which you spread the light, you resolve the light into the individual wavelengths.  And then you can see the signature of the chemical elements as they form in the star.  And these signatures — you usually assume they have a fixed wavelength.  If you observe them at a slightly different wavelength, this is due to the doppler effect.  And so with this doppler effect, we could see that one of the stars was moving, not at a constant speed, but it was moving back and forth with a relatively high velocity.  Amplitude of 60km/s [about 37 miles per second].  And a long period of 40 days.


As I said, with the combination of Kepler's and Newton's law that is called the [binary] mass function, you can use these numbers to get a mass of what it must orbit about.  It's a principle, the same technology we use for finding planets, which is called radial velocity technique.


((WN))  How did you get involved in this study?


((Thomas Rivinius))  From the very beginning.  As I said, I was interested in Be star[s].  Actually most of the team [...]  We were originally arranging this observations of many Be stars and it just turned out this one was particular very interesting.


((WN))  Apart from [the] European Southern Observatory, which other observatories were involved in this discovery?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Uh, none.  So only European Southern Observatory plus the observatory at La Silla.  Two different telescopes.


((WN))  Okay.  Which were the two telescopes?


((Thomas Rivinius))  The 1.52 and 2.2m.  The point is we always use the same instrument but it was moved at some point from ESO 1.52 to the 2.2m of the Max Planck Society.


((WN))  Were all the observations made from the La Silla Observatory?


((Thomas Rivinius))  From La Silla not.  There are other observations available, but we have not used them yet in this study.  There are observations available that were made by amateur astronomers, there's a data based of amateur spectroscopy, there are observations in the archives that were made from the Paranal Observatory.  So at some point, we are going to look at all those observations, but for the discovery purpose, we only used the observations that were taken from La Silla.


((WN))  How many people were involved in this discovery?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Right now the paper has I think five co-authors.  And there is a sixth person, Stan Štef, who some years ago died in a car accident.  And I believe — the paper is dedicated to him.  He is not on the co-author list because this particular paper was written completely new.  And if he never had a chance to actually even read the draft, then someone should not be co-author.


((WN))  What were the roles of the people involved in the discovery?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Marianne Heida and Dietrich Baade were the ones that originally triggered the idea.  Well, it's a long study because originally, we studied if for a different purpose.  In this different purpose, it was me, Dietrich Baade, and Petr Hadrava.  And we wanted to study it as a binary.  Robert Klement was a student of Petr Hadrava and he then also later and now assisted in the study of binary parameters.  And Marianne Heida is an expert on X-ray binaries, which have a lot of black holes.  So she was originally putting us on the track by presenting another paper on a black hole.


((WN))  What was the timeline of this study?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Well, it took 20 years, as I said; we started observing in 1999.  This is a typical scientific discovery: you find something you are not looking for.


((WN))  Which activity took the most time and attention?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Well, what took the most time was basically to realise that there is something that unusual in it.  As I said, we originally thought it was something different.  And then analysed it.  Found it was not what we had expected and so on and all that drags it out.  And then of course there's that Stan Štefl was a major driver in the study. He died in 2014 which basically stalled the study after that until now.


It was now that we picked it out because there was another paper appearing on a similar object, which, looking at that paper, I realised that HR 6819 must be of the same type.


((WN))  What was the most difficult part of this investigation?


((Thomas Rivinius))  As it basically is for any investigation: you very early on have an idea what it might be.  And it is always, the most difficult part is to always to make it sure in such a way that also the colleagues would believe it.  You have to explore any other options, any possibilities and exclude them one-by-one.


((WN))  What was your first reaction when confirming the unseen member of the triplet was a black hole?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Well it depends.  I mean, the first suggestion that it was a black hole surfaced in 2010.  But then we were very cautious.  Because we were not quite sure.  At that point we hadn't really excluded everything else.  And so, this was a very cautious time.  And then Stan died, but when I looked at it back in 2019, I managed to convince myself relatively quickly now, whatever I had learned in the past six years.


((WN))  How old is this system?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Judging from the two other stars that still exist in there, these two other stars must [be] between 15 and 70 million years old (myr).  Probably closer to the high upper end.  Probably closer to 70 million years.  That is probably the age of the system.


((WN))  How rare is the occurrence of the stellar systems with black holes?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Well, when we are talking about black holes of the stellar mass, not supermassive black holes like are in the hearts of the galaxies, only 50 of them are known.  And most of them are in binaries.  Because, as I say, a single black hole is almost impossible to find.  It is, however, one of the first we are certain of, or at least the one we are most certain that it is not in binary — one companion — but a triple, with two companions.


((WN))  How different are the stellar systems with black holes as compared to the ones without it?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Well, black hole is the end phase of the stellar evolution.  So every triple system that has a star with higher than 12 solar masses, at some point must have a supernova explosion that results in either a neutron star or a black hole.  The question is not — these progenitor systems, they are very abundant, they exist everywhere.  The question is how frequently they survive these explosions.  That is something completely unknown.  But I suspect there are quite many of them.


((WN))  This black hole does not have an accretion disk.  What does this tell us about the system?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Not very much.  It will eventually acquire an accretion disk.  The two other stars are not very evolved.  They are still small and compact.  As soon as they start evolving — in particular, the inner one — it will grow, and once it has grown enough, the black hole will start to accrete from it.  But there is a couple of million years to go still, at least.


((WN))  Tell us about the orbits of the two stars in HR 6819.


((Thomas Rivinius))  Well the inner orbit is relatively fast.  It's 40 days.  That's not an unusual orbital period, for two stars.  But, the amplitude is very high: the speed with which they orbit each other is high: it is 60 km/s.  And together with the 40 days, that makes a minimum mass of the other object.  The outer orbit we don't know.  It is very far away.  It's probably, judging from the similarity to other systems [...], it is probably several decades.  It could be even long[er].


((RS))  How close do these stars get? 


((Thomas Rivinius))  Since the orbit is circular, they will always stay at the same distance — at least the inner two, the black hole and the other star.  For now, they will stay at the same distance.  They will not get closer or farther from each other.  They are about as far as, closer than the Sun and the Earth (1au, 150 million km (93 million miles).  The precise value is not known because it depends on the inclination angle of the system: whether we see the system edge-on, or whether we see it face-on.


((WN))  Is the black hole assigned an official name?


((Thomas Rivinius))  For naming, naming is the job of International Astronomical Union.  So.  Traditionally you would call it as Component A, Component B, Component Aa: something like that.  But even that, I am not entirely sure how that would go.  Because whether you do this by mass, or sometimes you call the ""A"" which the most massive, sometimes you call ""A"" which is the most brightest, so.


((WN))  Does the team refer to the name by an unofficial name?


((Thomas Rivinius))  No.  Not really.


((WN))  What are some of the properties of this black hole?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Ah, black holes don't really have properties.  It's mass.  That's it.  It has at least the mass of 4.3 Solar [Mass], which means it has a diameter of maybe about 30 km (18.64 miles).  That's about it.  There's not many more properties a black hole can have.


((WN))  When I asked about the properties of the black hole, I was hoping you would remark on the spin, Swartzchild radii and the charge.


((Thomas Rivinius))  The radius is about 15 km (9.3 miles), as I said. Nothing is known about spin or charge, but it is likely that charge is zero or close to that.


((WN))  What do we know about the history of this black hole?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Only that it comes from a supernova, and that the triple system still survives.  That is basically telling us something about the explosion must have been symmetric in a sense.  Because if it had been asymmetric, the system would have been disrupted.


((WN))  What are the affects of the black hole on the star closer to it?


((Thomas Rivinius))  None.  It's pulling — the gravity — but another star would just pull the same.  So it has no radiation.  It has not accrete.  It is only forcing it into an orbit.  Nothing else.


((WN))  What were the challenges the team faced to discover this black hole?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Well, as I said before, it is basically to make sure that you have excluded all other options.  It's really: science is really about excluding the alternatives and, so that finally only one possibility remains.


((WN))  How are the black holes with the accretion disk different form those which don't have one?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Ah, if they have something to accrete, then something falls into the black hole.  And in that process, they produce all sorts of emission.  They produce X-ray emission, radio emission.  And ours does too, but it really is just black.


((WN))  As you mentioned, x-ray emission helps detecting the black holes with accretion disk.  What are some of the other ways we can detect black holes without accretion disks?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Ah, I don't think there's many other ways.  You wouldn't get them unless they have another object which you can detect.  And then you have to infer it from the gravitational effects, like its orbit.


((WN))  Do these stars orbiting the black hole have any known planets?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Ah, no, and considering their type, it is rather unlikely.  These kinds [...] as far as I know don't really have planets.  They are too violent, the deformation process is too massive.  Planets are normally around older or less massive stars.


((WN))  The report mentioned the spectroscopic time series of HR 6819 was similar to LB-1.  Tell us more about the system LB-1.


((Thomas Rivinius))  It's basically the same.  This was a press release form the Chinese National Academy of Sciences in November.  And back then they claimed it is only a binary, one is a normal star, the other is a black hole.  It has an accretion disk.  And from this they infer it could have had very high mass.  But from a technical point of view, this type of analysis is incorrect.  It was, at least to me, looking at the system it looks fairly clear that the effect they ascribe to the black hole which they thought was an accretion disk must be an outer object — a third star nearby — of this Be type, which makes the emission line.  So it is basically looking at the paper and realising that they are not right in their result but I know what it is, and that realising I have something similar just in my drawer.


((WN))  In what ways are LB-1 and HR 6819 similar and dissimilar?


((Thomas Rivinius))  They are similar in almost every aspect.  The inner B star, as far as we can tell at the moment.  The B star that is close to the black hole [of LB-1] is rotating even slower than in HR 6819.  It could be that it has been a bit modified: that it already has either transferred mass to the black hole or the progenitor of the black hole has transferred mass[...]  For [HR] 6819, there's no such indication.  But otherwise, we believe they are essentially the same.


((WN))  In what ways would the Solar System be different if the Sun was in the inner star's orbit, orbiting this black hole?


((Thomas Rivinius))  It would not exist.  As I said, planets simply would not form around such a massive binary.  Planet formation around binary in principle is possible.  But the inner star would have been a star with at least 12, maybe 20 solar masses.  And these stars form very quickly, burn very quickly, die very quickly.  Planets would simply not have had the time to form along such an object.


((WN))  No, considering our Solar System was there.


((Thomas Rivinius))  Right now?  Well, if you just put a Solar System there, that exists, it would probably destroy Mercury, it wouldn't exist, it would be not in a stable orbit.  Probably also Venus would not be in a stable orbit.  In the region of Earth, the orbit could be stable.  So maybe Earth could just so barely exist.  The seasons would be different.  There would be a strong 40-day modulation, which makes every 20 days — or every 40 days you get a lot of radiation.  Every 40 days, you get only much less radiation.  So it would be very hostile to life.


((WN))  What were the different radiation emissions observed in this system?


((Thomas Rivinius))  There is only visible light so far.  We know of no other [radiation spectrum].


((WN))  What are some of the other observed systems that have similar radiation emission?


((Thomas Rivinius))  As I said, this is from the point-of-view of the stars, these are just normal stars.  And the black hole does not contribute anything to the emission of the radiation.


((WN))  What does the future of these stars look like?


((Thomas Rivinius))  The outer star will just evolve very normally just like any other star of its mass.  The inner star will become a super giant as well.  But when it ends its supergiant phase, it will be big enough to get accounted into the black hole and then the black hole will start accreting.  It is hard to say what happens then.  It may get big enough for the black hole to actually fall into the star, and then shortly after the star falls into the black hole, or it might end with the accretion.


((WN))  So you are saying there is a chance the black hole may create an accretion disk feeding on this inner star?


((Thomas Rivinius))  It will certainly.  But it will take another few million years.


((WN))  Were you expecting a black hole to be so close to the Solar System?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Ah yes, as I said, there must be many black holes.  I mean, there are certainly black holes which are closer.  It's just not very likely to find them.  They are not infrequent objects.  They are interestingly very frequent objects.  There are just very hard to find.


((WN))  What future investigations is your team planning for?


((Thomas Rivinius))  With interferometry, we want to image that, and maybe we want to look in the catalogues if we can find a similar system.  We are looking for candidates where we might reasonably expect that it might be similar and then we can have a look in detail.


((WN))  What lies ahead in this system to be discovered?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Well, basically what we still have to do with this system is to make the numbers certain.  Right now, what we have is limits.  We have a lower limit for the mass.  But what we can do is we get precise value for the mass.  We only have a rough distance, we can get a precise distance.  We can measure the chemical composition of the stars that still exists, if they in any way have been altered or affected by the original primary, when the most massive star went supernova.  So it should tell us a lot, in principle, about heterogeneous systems about how such massive stars evolve.


((WN))  Are there any plans to observe the nearby binary stars for black holes?


((Thomas Rivinius))  As I said, we are looking into the catalogues.  If we can find similar systems that could give us hints, that might be promising candidates.  But even if they are frequent, they are not that frequent that we could observe every star and just look for black holes.  That is not an efficient use of telescope time.


((WN))  Are there any other observations you have been working on?


((Thomas Rivinius))  Ah, well, there's a lot of things I'm working on.  But they are unrelated to this particular project.


((WN))  What is your role at the ESO?


((Thomas Rivinius))  At the ESO, I am a science operations astronomer.  Which means that I run the telscopes; I support other astronomers when they come here to conduct the observations, and when they cannot come, or do not want to come which also happens, I do the observations for them.  And I do this about 60% of my working time, I work for the observatory in this capacity, and one third of my working time I do my own research.


((WN))  Well, those were all the questions I had for you.  Is there something you would like to add?


((Thomas Rivinius))  No, I think that was fine, thank you.


((WN))  Thank you for agreeing for this interview.  It had been a great pleasure discussing this with you.


((Thomas Rivinius))  Thank you.  Ciao.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Japanese_professional_wrestler_and_Netflix_star_Hana_Kimura_dies_aged_22,2020-05-24,Japanese professional wrestler and Netflix star Hana Kimura dies aged 22,"Japanese female professional wrestler and reality television star Hana Kimura, age 22, has died, wrestling promotion World Wonder Ring Stardom (Stardom) announced yesterday. No cause of death was announced. Kimura reportedly made several post on social media suggesting she was a victim of cyber-bullying shortly before her death. Her final Instagram story post was a photograph of her and her cat with ""goodbye"" written as the caption. 


Kimura was signed for Stardom at the time of her death, having joined them in 2019. Stardom's official statement yesterday read ""Stardom fans, We are very sorry to report that our Hana Kimura has passed away. Please be respectful and allow some time for things to process, and keep your thoughts and prayers with her family and friends. We appreciate your support during this difficult time."" 


Kimura made her profesional wrestling debut in 2016 for promotion Wrestle-1. As well as Stardom she also wrestled for Senjo and JWP, the later where she won her first championship, the JWP Junior Championship. With Stardom she was a two-time  Artist of Stardom champion and a one-time Goddess of Stardom champion. Her mother is professional wrestler Kyoko Kimura.


Outside of wrestling, Kimura was currently one of the stars on reality television show Terrace House. The Netflix show, which is currently on hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sees three males and three females temporarily move in together. According to Wrestling Inc, she received online criticism for her appearances on the show. Sky News reported Netflix Japan due to Kimura's death have delayed releasing a new episode.


Wrestling sportswriter Dave Meltzer tweeted after hearing the news of her death. He said ""Hana Kimura just passed away.  There are no other details at the moment but this is a death that can be blamed on the cruelty of social media and it's a subject that really needs addressing"".

The arrest came after an allegation he assaulted Neka Dorokashvili, his ex-wife.  The Tbilisi city court set bail yesterday at 100,000 Georgian lari (about US$30,000).


The charge was denied by Irma Tchkadua, Basilashvili's lawyer. Preliminary court date is July 16. The punishment for domestic abuse in front of a minor is a maximum of three years in prison or 200–400 hours of community service. 


The Georgian Tennis Federation (GFT) released a statement addressing Basilashvili's arrest. It read, ""First of all, we would like to state that Georgian Tennis Federation has always condemned any form of violence [...] The incident involving Nikoloz Basilashvili is currently under police investigation and GFT will refrain from either announcing its position on the matter or making any comments until such investigation is completed.""


Currently ranked 27th in the world ATP rankings, Basilashvili reached a career high of number 16 in May 2019. He has made a career total $5,479,761 in prize money earnings, according to The Guardian.

The coronavirus causes COVID-19, a sometimes-fatal disease. The milestone came just under a month after the total number of confirmed infections in the United States surpassed one million on April 28.


As of Wednesday, the United States had the highest number of known infections, accounting for around 30% of world-wide coronavirus infections with over 1.6 million confirmed cases. The United States likewise had the highest number of confirmed deaths linked to the coronavirus, with the next highest country, the United Kingdom, reporting 37,542 deaths as of Wednesday.


The milestone came as states began to relax restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the coronavirus may cause roughly 32,000 more deaths in the United States by August 4.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/SpaceX_successfully_launches_its_first_crewed_spaceflight,2020-05-31,SpaceX successfully launches its first crewed spaceflight,"SpaceX successfully launched its first crewed mission at 1922 UTC yesterday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, US with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley in a Crew Dragon capsule atop a Falcon 9 rocket. This was the first launch of a crewed spacecraft from the United States since NASA's final Space Shuttle mission in July 2011 — a mission Hurley piloted.


SpaceX, backed by entrepreneur Elon Musk, is the first private company to send astronauts into space. The company has engineered and operated reusable rockets, potentially reducing the overall cost of future space missions. Shortly after the launch, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage disengaged and returned to an autonomous spaceport drone ship off the coast, to be refurbished and reused on a future mission. Behnken and Hurley are slated to catch up to the International Space Station (ISS) for a stay of one to four months, docking today at 1429 UTC.


The originally planned launch on Wednesday afternoon, local time, was scrubbed due to inclement weather conditions less than 20 minutes before scheduled launch time, with the schedule pushed back to yesterday. Unlike Wednesday's scrub, however, yesterday's launch proceeded without issue.  Hurley, on radio following the minutes-long ride to low Earth orbit, said, ""It was incredible"".


SpaceX's launch is the latest development in a program initiated in earnest by NASA's 2014 selection of SpaceX, along with Boeing, to be an initial commercial contractor providing transportation for NASA astronauts to the ISS. Boeing's first crewed mission is reportedly expected to launch next year. Since the retirement of the Space Shuttles in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport its astronauts to the orbiting space station.


Hurley, along with his fellow crew members aboard the final Shuttle mission, had left a small U.S. flag aboard the ISS, to be retrieved when the U.S. space program was once again able to launch astronauts to the outpost. Hurley and Behnken, when they depart, plan to return this flag to Earth after a nearly nine-year hiatus to commemorate the milestone. The exact timing of their return is not set, however, as it depends on the continued performance of the Crew Dragon spacecraft, and on when the next Crew Dragon mission occurs, which NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has said may be ready to launch by late August.


Bridenstine remarked of the remainder of the test flight, ""I'm breathing a sigh of relief, but I will also tell you I'm not gonna celebrate until Bob and Doug are home safely."" Hurley, for his part, paraphrased the first U.S. citizen in space, Alan Shepard, commenting before launch on the occasion of the United States' return to human spaceflight capability: ""SpaceX we're go for launch. Let's light this candle.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/South_Sudanese_politician_John_Luk_Jok_dies_aged_about_68,2020-06-03,South Sudanese politician John Luk Jok dies aged about 68,"John Luk Jok, the South Sudanese minister for East African Affairs and a figure in independence from Sudan, died yesterday in Juba, the capital city of South Sudan. Luk, reportedly aged about 68, had suffered a prolonged illness, according to a family spokesperson. He is also credited with helping draft South Sudan's Transitional Constitution prior to independence in 2011.


Michael Makuei, the Information Minister paid tribute to Luk. He said on Voice of America's South Sudan in Focus programme ""It is a great loss to the people of South Sudan, because John Luk had contributed a lot, and him and myself has done a lot in the legal sector and in the negotiations and in all aspects of governance system in South Sudan. So his death is not only a loss to the community, but a loss to the people and the government of South Sudan"".


One of South Sudan's Vice Presidents, Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior, also commented on Luk's death to The EastAfrican. She said “John Luk was very honest, hardworking and a brilliant person who devoted his entire life to fight for South Sudan during the liberation processes until his death. He is a person the whole country will miss.” 


Prior to holding the post of East African Affairs minister, Luk reportedly held positions as transport, justice, and petroleum, energy, and mining minster at different times since independence. Prior to the 2011 independence he served as a legal advisor during peace negotiations.

A helicopter under contract to Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) on Tuesday struck power lines and crashed near Fairfield, California. Three occupants of the helicopter died and three firefighters were injured when their appliance rolled responding to an ensuing wildfire.


The Bell 206 came down near Interstate 80 around 13:30 local time, during works to high-voltage power cables in the area. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) said several acres of land burned before the flames were extinguished. CalFire requested power line de-energisation during the emergency which cut electric supply to around 38,000 people. CalFire indicated the injuries were minor.


The three deceased were reportedly PG&E contract employees. The company said power was restored by 20:21 following delays caused by warm weather at the time. Investigations have been launched by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, with the latter yesterday confirming on Twitter they were ""not traveling to the crash scene at this time."" Wikinews approached the NTSB regarding their decision not to visit the site, but as of today the board's press office did not respond.


PG&E, currently operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections, is currently upgrading its infrastructure to reduce wildfire risks, though as of reports on Tuesday the company had not confirmed what work the helicopter was undertaking. In a letter to The Mercury News, published on Monday, PG&E President and CEO Andy Vesey said the firm was working to install ""100 miles of stronger poles and covered power lines [and manage] vegetation along 890 miles of our system to reduce wildfire risk."" Vesey also indicated equipment is being added to lines to aid in shutdowns.

The measure, addressing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, would apply to people using public trains, buses, aircraft, and other modes.


Shapps announced the measure at the UK Government's daily coronavirus briefing. He said it would be ""a condition of travel"" and ""surgical masks[...] we must keep for clinical settings"" so the general public should use ""the kind of face covering you can easily make at home."" 


Those who violate the guidelines could be subject to a fine under National Rail Conditions of Travel and the Public Service Vehicle Regulations for Buses, as well as being denied from traveling. 


The measure would except very young children, disabled people, and those with breathing difficulties. 


Train drivers' trade union Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan commented, “We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain's train, and Tube, network is done in a safe and controlled manner – to help spread [the travellers], and maintain social distancing – for the safety of passengers and staff[...] The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”


The general secretary of the RMT union (National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers), Mick Cash, said the measure was ""nowhere near enough.""


The June 15 planned date of the introduction of the measures is the current expected date for the reopening of non-essential retail stores.


England would be the only country in the United Kingdom to have these measures put in place. Wales have made no recommendation regarding face covering. Northern Ireland has suggested people ""think about"" it in situations where they cannot apply social-distancing.


Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a compulsory introduction of face coverings could be ""inevitable"" and that she was considering it.

He was 34 and reported extensively on the nation's ongoing civil war.


—Sabrina Bennoui, of RSF

Al-Quaety, who contributed to Agence France-Presse among other news organizations, openly supported independence for South Yemen. The Southern Transitional Council, previously an ally of the government, is currently in conflict against it. Both sides also oppose Houthi rebels. Both the council and the government called for his death to be investigated.


Multiple assailants attacked al-Quaety shortly after he left his nearby home, then, according to security officials, fled. He is survived by three children and his pregnant wife. A freelancer, he was a 2016 Rory Peck Awards finalist for his coverage of the conflict. In 2019 he survived a drone attack that left six soldiers dead. The city's security chief, Abdullah al-Jahafi, announced on Facebook on Tuesday there were suspects in custody.


""Nabil's murder is unacceptable and constitutes a terrible new blow to journalism in Yemen[...]  journalists are now favourite targets, regardless of the region they cover"", said Sabrina Bennoui of Reporters Without Borders. Phil Chetwynd, director of global news for AFP, called the death ""the senseless killing of a courageous journalist doing his job despite threats and intimidation."" Chetwynd also praised the quality of al-Quaety's work.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Fire_at_historic_Welsh_ex-hotel_Bontddu_Hall_kills_one,2020-06-06,Fire at historic Welsh ex-hotel Bontddu Hall kills one,"A fire broke out yesterday at Bontddu Hall near Dolgellau in Gwynedd, Wales. The historic mansion is a former hotel with high-profile guests. A rescued woman died at the scene.


North Wales Fire and Rescue Service were called to the building, located off the A496 overlooking the Mawddach Estuary in Snowdonia National Park, at 09:09am local time. Resources sent included appliances from Dolgellau, Harlech, Barmouth, Bala, and Blaenau Ffestiniog according to a fire service statement, as well as an aerial ladder platform, high volume pump, and the service's incident command unit. 


Police, the ambulance service, and an air ambulance also attended. Photos and video from the blaze showed thick smoke with flames visible at windows. The fire service indicated an investigation working alongside North Wales Police was underway. Bontddu Hall recently underwent building work and scaffolding was still erected at the time of the fire.


Bontddu Hall dates to 1873, originally a 20-room mansion, and was a country retreat for the Mayor of Birmingham called Bryn Tirion before becoming a hotel. Guests include regular visitor ex-UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and actor Richard Burton who stayed at Bontddu Hall while filming his 1949 movie debut The Last Days of Dolwyn.


The hotel closed around fifteen years ago, with local press reporting in 2004 then-new owner Tong Yung-soo, who had purchased Bontddu Hall in 2001, and his wife applied to make it a residence once more. The move was met with what WalesOnline called ""fury"" from local tourism chiefs. The then-manager of Barmouth Publicity and Director of Mid Wales Tourism Partnership, David Clay, called it ""a retrograde step"" and said ""[a]n area like this cannot afford to lose such a quality hotel.""


The Tongs indicated issues staffing the hotel, something Clay recognised, and Mr Tong had said they intended to ""restore the hall to its former glory."" Following the hotel's closure it has remained a private home.

Authorities said they believed a fruit filled with firecrackers had exploded in her mouth, damaging her jaw and ultimately leading to her death.


According to wildlife officials, the 15-year-old elephant's injuries were discovered on May 25 after she was observed standing in the Velliyar River. Despite attempts by officials to lure her out using two other elephants, the injured elephant remained in the river and died two days later. An autopsy determined the elephant was pregnant before she was cremated. Citing the elephant's reduced body size, officials estimated she may have starved for up to 20 days or longer. The incident gained media attention after local wildlife officer Mohan Krishnan shared his experience on Facebook. Some people expressed their outrage on social media as the incident became known.


Officials later announced an arrest of a rubber tapper — a man in his forties identified only as ""P Wilson"" — in the elephant's death while as of yesterday two other suspects were reportedly at large. Initial reports stated the firecracker-laden fruit was a pineapple; NDTV later reported officials, following an investigation, stated it was a coconut. Forest officials suggested the elephant may have tried to eat a ""pig cracker"" meant to repel wild boars.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Burundi_President_Pierre_Nkurunziza_dies_aged_55,2020-06-11,Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza dies aged 55,"Pierre Nkurunziza, the President of Burundi, died at the age of 55 on Monday. The government of Burundi on Tuesday announced his death and announced the cause of death as a cardiac arrest. Nkurunziza became president of the African nation in 2005 and was due to stand down in August.


The government statement, which was posted on Twitter, announced the President's death ""with great sorrow to Burundians and the international community."" Nkurunziza was taken ill on Saturday evening, after attending a volleyball game, and taken to hospital. Despite signs of recovery on Sunday, he suffered a cardiac arrest on Monday and died, government officials stated. They also declared seven days of national mourning. 


As of Tuesday, his widow, Denise, was being medically treated in Kenya. An Al Jazeera reporter in Kenya noted local news reports said she was diagnosed with COVID-19.


Nkurunziza was currently serving his third term as president after first being elected in 2005. His decision to run for a third term led to tensions and a failed coup in the country in which hundreds died. The constitution was changed again, allowing him to run for a forth term, before he announced he would stand down. His presidential term was to end in August, in favor of his elected successor, Evariste Ndayishimiye.


Burundi had twelve years of civil war leading up to Nkurunziza's presidency. Around 300,000 people were killed in the conflict, during which Nkurunziza served in the CNDD-FDD, the group that would eventually become the nation's ruling party.

Jackals are protected in India.


Officials said a police constable, reportedly one Vijayaragavan, saw the twelve with the dead jackal in Trichy, decided to question them after they aroused suspicion at a tea stall, and learned they were responsible for the jackal's death.  The forestry department arrested them.  According to local news sources, the constable found the jackal's bagged carcass after inquiring.


The suspects range in age from 21 to 78 and were identified as Narikuravars from the village of Poolangudi.  They were taken into the custody of the forestry department. Authorities said the killing occurred in Jeeyapuram forest in a bid to gain jackal meat and teeth.


The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 lists jackals as a protected species. India's jackals face attention from poachers, who sell the parts. One study in the Journal of Threatened Taxa from March noted authorities seized 126 skins, eight tails, 16 skulls and two live jackals from 2013 to 2019. The same study also noted over 370 ""jackal horns"" seized in the same period. Jackal horns are crafted from skulls of jackals and are considered talismans.


Last week, in the neighbouring state of Kerala, one suspect was arrested in connection with the death of a pregnant female elephant suffering from explosive injuries.  Authorities said they believed a fruit filled with firecrackers had exploded in the elephant's mouth, damaging her jaw and ultimately leading to her death.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/On_the_campaign_trail_in_the_USA,_May_2020",2020-06-19,"On the campaign trail in the USA, May 2020","The following is the first edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.


This month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the Constitution and Libertarian parties as well as the chosen running mate of the leading Green Party presidential candidate. 


At the beginning of May, with the Coronavirus Pandemic ongoing and stay-at-home orders easing in some states, presumptive US Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden led incumbent US President Donald Trump of the Republican Party in the RealClearPolitics average of head-to-head opinion polls, 47.4 percent to 42.1 percent.  In an April 30 – May 4 Monmouth poll with then-US Libertarian Party presidential candidate Congressman Justin Amash included, Biden led Trump 47 percent to 40 percent with 5 percent for Amash. 


Congressman Amash, who changed his party registration to Libertarian, contended for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, but dropped out of the race just ahead of the party's online National Convention. At the convention, the party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, Jo Jorgensen, won the presidential nomination.  Podcaster Spike Cohen received the vice presidential nomination.  In other third parties, at its own online national convention, the US Constitution Party nominated a ticket of businessman Don Blankenship for president and Michigan Taxpayers Party chairman William Mohr for vice president.  For the US Green Party, former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura joined the party and had signaled an intent to run but ultimately decided against it.   Labor activist Howie Hawkins broadened his lead among pledged Green Party delegates, approaching the number required to secure the nomination at the online Green National Convention, scheduled for July 11. Hawkins, who is also the presidential nominee of the Socialist Party USA, had his hopes of a left-wing coalition dashed when it was reported the ballot-qualified Peace and Freedom Party of California and the Liberty Union Party of Vermont chose Party for Socialism and Liberation presidential nominee Gloria La Riva as their presidential nominee.   Hawkins selected 2016 Socialist Party USA vice presidential nominee Angela Walker to be his running mate.

Biden first addressed the allegations of sexual assault from former staffer Tara Reade, on television program Morning Joe.  When confronted with the accusation he penetrated Reade, against her will, using his fingers under her clothing in 1993, Biden told host Mika Brzezinski ""No, it is not true. I am saying unequivocally it never, never happened, and it didn't. It never happened.""  Meanwhile, a new allegation surfaced from a woman, a niece of Biden's 2008 US Senate opponent Christine O'Donnell, who claimed Biden commented on the size of her breasts when she was 14 years old.  The campaign called the statement ""absolutely false.""  An organizer said Biden was not at the event specified.  O'Donnell defended her niece's claim, saying it may have taken place at a different time. 
Biden searched for a female running mate. 2018 gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams of Georgia, Congresswoman Val Demings of Florida, Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer were mentioned as possibilities.  Biden said he planned to announce his choice around August 1.  Continuing a trend from earlier months, Biden made a couple of gaffes in May.  First, he juxtaposed numbers, claiming 85,000 Americans were unemployed and millions had died from coronavirus.  More consequential, he told African American radio host Charlamagne tha God ""if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.""  Backlash from the statement led Biden to express ""I shouldn’t have been so cavalier [...]  No one should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background.""  In another incident, as Biden remarked on investigation, shortly before President Trump took office, of then-National Security Advisor-designee General Michael Flynn, Biden failed to mention his own request at the time to unmask Flynn's identity.  The unmasking came to light shortly thereafter in a release of documents related to alleged FISA abuse,  which President Trump described as ""Obamagate.""  An analysis of anti-Biden memes showed ""Dementia Joe"" as a popular characterization of Biden. 


President Trump made several controversial statements in May.  Early in the month, he received additional fallout from a statement he made in late April about the use of disinfectant inside the body to treat coronavirus.  He hinted that the White House Coronavirus Task Force would be disbanded, but later reversed himself.  Nevertheless, the task force's daily press conferences did cease.  Trump said he himself took the drug hydroxychloroquine, which he promoted early in the pandemic as a counter-measure against coronavirus, despite reports about the side effects.  He tweeted support for the protests to end statewide shutdown orders despite it undermining his own guidelines.  He also promoted an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory suggesting Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of a Congressional intern in 2001.  When Trump tweeted that state plans to use mail-in ballots to allow people to vote from home would result in voter fraud, Twitter placed a disclaimer ""fact checking"" the tweet.  In response, Trump issued an executive order making social media that exercises editorial control open to liability.  Twitter continued to edit Trump's tweets.  Trump tweeted about the riots that followed the death of George Floyd, an African American man who died in Minneapolis while a police officer restrained him.  Part of Trump's tweet included the statement, ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""  Twitter disallowed comments and likes and placed a warning over the tweet alerting viewers it promoted violence.  Trump later said he meant looting leads to somebody getting shot, perhaps by rioters.  The phrase itself has historic, racial overtones, of which Trump claimed to be unaware.  Meanwhile, Trump attended the joint NASA-Space X launch and delivered a speech to mark the occasion.


By the end of the month, with coronavirus deaths surpassing 100,000  and protests and riots related to the death of Floyd spreading throughout the nation, Biden maintained his lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics average of opinion polls, 48.4 percent to 42.5 percent. 


At the Constitution Party's 2020 National Convention conducted online May 2, the party nominated businessman Don Blankenship for president on the second ballot.  For vice president, the party unanimously chose Michigan Taxpayers Party — the Constitution Party's affiliate in Michigan — chairman William Mohr. 


While Blankenship has been widely covered for his role as CEO of Massey Energy during the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster that resulted in the deaths of 29 miners, his subsequent conviction for misdemeanor conspiracy to violate safety standards willfully, his one year imprisonment, and his unsuccessful 2018 campaign for the Republican Party's US Senate nomination in West Virginia,  Mohr is relatively unknown. He was a candidate for Michigan House of Representatives in every election from 2006 to 2014.  He received 3 percent of the vote in his 2012 run and 2.3 percent in his 2014 run.


In 2016, the Constitution Party ticket of Darrell Castle for president and Scott Bradley for vice president received 203,091 votes (0.15 percent)  with ballot access in 24 states.   For 2020 the party is currently on the ballot in 14 states. 


With Wikinews, Mohr discussed how his nomination for vice president came about, his role on the Blankenship/Mohr ticket, and the prospects for the ticket.

((WSS))  With the coronavirus pandemic hampering ballot access efforts, is it possible to improve on the electoral performance of 2016 presidential nominee Darrell Castle?  What can you do to improve the visibility of the ticket?


On May 23 at the online Libertarian National Convention, the Libertarian Party nominated Clemson University psychologist Jo Jorgensen, the party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, for president on the fourth ballot.  The next day, the party nominated podcast host Jeremy ""Spike"" Cohen for vice president on the third ballot.  Cohen, who went into the convention as the running mate of performance artist Vermin Supreme, was not the candidate Jorgensen initially backed for the vice presidential nomination.


Cohen, who goes by his nickname ""Spike"", which he has explained derives from a character on ‘’My Little Pony’’, was initially a neoconservative but shifted to libertarianism.  In 2016, he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. He is co-owner of Muddied Waters Media, which features his podcast (((My Fellow Americans))).


With Wikinews, Cohen discussed his journey from neoconservatism to libertarianism, his role on the Jorgensen-Cohen ticket, and how to improve on the performance of the party's 2016 ticket of former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson for president and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld for vice president, which received 4,489,235 votes (3.27 percent).

((WSS))  How would you describe your role as vice presidential nominee?  How do you complement Jo Jorgensen on the ticket?


((WSS))  How can you improve on the performance of Johnson-Weld in 2016?


On May 5, US Green Party presidential frontrunner and the presidential nominee of Socialist Party USA, Howie Hawkins, announced his selection of a running mate for the 2020 presidential race.  Hawkins, a union leader and co-founder of the Green Party approaching securing the delegates required for the Green Party's presidential nomination, tapped Socialist Party USA's 2016 vice presidential nominee Angela Walker. 


Walker, a truck driver who currently resides in South Carolina, first met Hawkins in 2014 while she was running for Sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin as an independent socialist and Hawkins was running for governor of New York for the Green Party.  Walker received 20 percent of the vote in her race  and Hawkins received five percent in his.   That showing was Hawkins' best in three successive runs for governor — 2010, 2014, 2018.  In 2016, Walker was Mimi Soltysik's running mate with Socialist Party USA.  The ticket received 2,705 votes.


The Green Party, which received 1,457,226 votes (1.06 percent) with the 2016 ticket of Jill Stein for president and Ajamu Baraka for vice president, is to nominate its ticket officially at its online national convention July 11.


Wikinews reached out to Walker to discuss how her past experience impacts the current race, why Hawkins/Walker is the best choice for leftists and socialists, and what goals she has for this campaign. 


((WSS))  How does your experience as a nominee for vice president in 2016 help in the current campaign? How is your role the same or different from 2016?  


((WSS))  Why should leftists and socialists support Howie Hawkins over Gloria La Riva or the Bernie Sanders-backed candidate Joe Biden?

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/British_supermarket_chain_Tesco_to_sell_its_Polish_branch_to_Salling_Group_A/S,2020-06-21,British supermarket chain Tesco to sell its Polish branch to Salling Group A/S,"On Thursday, UK-based retailer Tesco and Denmark-based retailer Salling Group announced their agreement over selling a large portion of Tesco's Polish operation to Salling Group. Tesco stated its intention to leave the Polish market altogether, Salling its intention to strengthen its Netto chain in Poland.


The deal covers 301 stores, two distribution centers and the head office. With the acquisition Salling said it seeks to improve its coverage in Southern Poland and, over 18 months at a cost of one billion złotys, intends to merge these stores into its currently 386 strong Netto chain. Salling also takes over about 7000 employees from Tesco — Netto Poland currently has about 5000 employees. Tesco continues to run 19 stores, which were not included in this package. 


The sale price, to be payed in cash, is 900 million złotys (181 million pounds). In the 2019/20 fiscal year, Tesco said its Polish branch had a 24 million pounds operating loss with a 1368 million pounds turnover; to which the sold units contributed with a 947 million pounds turnover for a 107 million loss. At fiscal year-end, the sold units held a value of 681 million pounds in the books.


UOKiK, the Polish anti-monopoly agency, has to approve the deal. The parties said they expect a decision this year.


Tesco has suffered losses from its Polish operation for several years, as customer preference has shifted away from hypermarkets, Tesco's preferred store size, to smaller discount stores like Biedronka and LIDL. The Sunday trade ban, introduced in 2018, also hurt sales. According to Notes from Poland (NFP), some discount stores resorted to offer postal services, a loophole which allows Sunday opening hours.


In 2015, Tesco centralized its management in the Central European region, comprising Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, but reverted the decision later on. At the time, the company invested in e-commerce and started home deliveries, but Gazeta Prawna reports only 0.5% of Polish grocery turnover comes from this segment, compared to 7% in the United Kingdom.


In the past few years, Tesco Polska has cut expenditures by streamlining its product range, halving its staff, shutting off home deliveries in parts of the country, and closing off stores, reportedly including last year its Poznan distribution center. Deutsche Welle (DW) reported in mid-2019, 62 Tesco outlets had closed within a year. Staff layoffs left meat, fish and delicatessen departments without designated shop assistants, and forced staff canteen closures and administration simplifications.


Tesco sold its roughly 2000 Thai and 74 Malaysian stores to Charoen Pokphand in March; announced leaving its joint venture with China Resources Holdings in February; and in 2015 sold its South Korean chain HomePlus. Speaking to Portfolio.hu, Matt Simister, Tesco’s CEO for Central Europe, explained that the company held a 4% share of the Polish retail market, compared to its 16% share in Hungary, and stated they want to stay in Hungary. In a DW report in March of last year, Dave Lewis, CEO of Tesco, stated they did not have intentions of leaving Thailand or Poland.


Tesco's Polish operation, according to Gazeta Wyborcza in March, is too big for a single monolithic sale. The chain's press release reported 22 sold units in the past year and a half, for around 200 million pounds. NFP named the Kaufland chain and property developer Echo Investment among the buyers.


Both Tesco and Salling entered the Polish market in 1995.

A 25-year-old man was arrested by Thames Valley Police on suspicion of murder. Reports named him on Sunday as Reading resident and Libyan national Khairi Saadallah. Police also announced on Sunday morning they were treating it as a terrorist incident.


The Daily Telegraph cited a security source that mental health may be a factor in the attack. Witnesses, according to The Telegraph, said a man approached and attacked a group of middle-aged men, using a knife. Thames Valley Police soon arrived and detained the man, later identified as Khairi Saadallah. Saadallah came to the UK a number of years ago, after the Libyan Civil War. A counter terror police raid removed various items from Saadallah's flat, amongst them reportedly a circular saw.


The head of the UK's counter terror police, Neil Basu, on Sunday said the police found nothing inconsistent with the attacker acting alone. He also said there is no suggestion of specific increased threat towards people in crowded places from terrorists. A Black Lives Matter protest had taken place in Forbury Gardens a few hours before the attack, but Basu also stated this was not connected to the crime.

The now-extinct species used to carefully select bones from a particular animal species to manufacture their bone tools, the research showed.  The research was published on May 8 in Nature's Scientific Reports journal.


Dr Martisius and her team used five bone tools discovered from Neanderthals' sites in southwest France for this research.  Four of these bone tools were found in a site called Abri Peyrony and the other one was from Pech-de-l’Azé I.  These tools were just a few centimetres in size and were about 50 thousand years old, Dr Martisius told Wikinews.  Microscopy analysis of these bone tools called lissoirs (smoothers) suggested Neanderthals used these tools for working animal skin to leathers.


The study stated the fauna of the sites were primarily medium-sized ungulates such as reindeer, in one layer nearly 90%.  Despite the overabundance of medium-sized ungulates, Neanderthals used ribs of large bovids for making lissoirs.  Dr Martisius told Wikinews this was likely due to the physical characteristics of the bovid ribs, which were ""thicker"" and ""stronger"" as compared to the ""thin and flimsy ribs"" of reindeers.  In order to check the origins of the bone tools, the researchers used a technology called non-destructive Zooarchæology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS).


Instead of damaging the bone artefacts in order to discover its origins, the researchers collected collagen from the plastic containers in which these artefacts were kept.  Collagen is a type of protein.  These bone artefacts were kept in plastic containers: some were kept for about five years, some for just a few months.  During this time, the collagen proteins from bone tools were stuck to the walls of its plastic containers.  The collagen samples collected from the walls of the containers are broken into smaller molecules called peptides by using a chemical enzyme called trypsin.


After the trypsin has broken collagen fibres into peptides, it is analysed using a technology called Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (ToF MS).  The assisting matrix is a coloured compound.  The acidic peptide is combined with the matrix, vapourised, and peptides are released.  Some of them are positively-charged particles which travel across a vacuum tube in an electric field.  Depending on the weight of the peptides, these molecules reach the end of the vacuum tube at different instances of time, forming a spectrum.  These graphs are like unique fingerprints of a species: they are different for different species of animals.  Looking at the database of such graphs, taxonomic identifications of the collagen proteins came be made.


All four bone tools from Abri Peyrony gave positive results and showed that the bones were made from large bovids, even though reindeer were more abundant during that time.  One of the advantages of using bovid ribs over reindeer's thin ribs was the bovid ribs would be more resistant to breaking during flexion, Dr Martisius said.


Dr Martisius said such non-destructive ZooMS analysis was previously conducted, but for tools no older than a few centuries.  She said such an analysis had never been previously conducted for artefacts so ancient.


Wikinews caught up with Dr Martisius to discuss this research in-depth.


Thank you for agreeing to discuss your findings.  I'd like to ask you about your discovery: its findings, and the inferences of, and anything that we can do for the future investigation.


((Naomi Martisius))  That's a lot you just said out there.


((WN))  What prompted your interest in archæology?


((Naomi Martisius))   Okay.  Well, I guess that goes back all the way to my childhood; it's sort of a lifelong thing for me.  My father was very interested in history.  So I think that sort of inspired me to study ancient humans, I guess.  But specifically archæology: I really had no idea what archæology is.  And I think that the general public also doesn't really have an idea of what archæology is.  And so, it wasn't until I got into school, started studying it, that I figure[d] out what archæology was.  You know, it's so much more than history, or studying artefacts to interpret history, right?  History is more so, about what is written down, what the prominent people in society wrote down, right?  And archæology is about figuring out what normal everyday people did.  So, I think it's — I think it's really cool what we can learn doing archæology.


((WN))  What was the initial purpose of this study?


((Naomi Martisius))  So.  The initial purpose, really, was just to find out what animals the bone — I was studying bone tools for my dissertation, and, there's all sorts of different things one can learn, studying bone tools.  But, to specifically figure out what animals these bones came from would be a little more difficult studying bone tools because bone tools are transformed, either through manufacturing or through use, or both depending on which bone tools they are.  But these were small little fragments, really really hard to identify based on morphological characteristics alone.
So we wanted to apply this method ZooMS to look at the — well, to study the collagen in the bone, to then assess what animals these bones came from.


((WN))  Could you briefly explain the study and its findings?


((Naomi Martisius))  I don't know how brief I can be, but, I'll try to be brief.  [laughs]  Like I mentioned in the previous question, I was studying these bone tools; they're specifically bone tools that Neandertals made and used; and we just had five of these.  They came from two different sites in the southwest of France.  One artefact came from this one site called Pech-de-l’Azé I, and then four came from another site Abri Peyrony; and these bone tools were found actually across three different archæoological layers; there are two different archæoological layers at Abri Peyrony.


So, these five bone tools are all pretty similar.  They all looked very similar, they had a similar size, similar shape; they all came from some sort of animal rib, we can tell that by doing a morphological analysis — but we wanted to use Zooarchæology by Mass Spectrometry to try to assess what animal species the bones came from.  I mentioned the one, from this other site Pech-de-l’Azé: we didn't get any results from that one artefact; but then the four from Abri Peyrony, they all came back with positive results, all actually having the same ID, either coming from bison or aurochs; so, some sort of large bovid.


And then, there's so much more involved in the study too; those are the main results.  But then we compared the results from the ZooMS analysis to the zooarchæoological analysis from all of the faunal remains at the site.  And what was really cool was that in one of the archæoological layers, where three of these bone tools came from, the layer was dominated by reindeer, having ninety per cent reindeer remains in the site.


██ Hare: 3

██ Roe deer: 5

██ Red deer: 7

██ Reindeer: 276

██ Red deer/reindeer: 241

██ Cervid (antler tips): 2

██ Cervid/saiga: 1

██ Bison/Aurochs: 26

██ Large ungulate: 45

██ Rhinoceros: 1

██ medium carnivore: 1

██ large carnivore: 1

Just thinking about that — we did a whole statistical analysis too, but — just thinking about that: 90 per cent reindeer, and then three of these bone tools come from this large bovid, really really seems like Neandertals specifically chose to use the large bovid's ribs as their tool of choice; and then like I say we also did a statistical analysis that supported that as well, that Neandertals were selecting these large bovid ribs.


((WN))  How did you get involved in this study?


((Naomi Martisius))  So, that actually started back quite a while ago now, for me.  It was before I even got into graduate school.  It was back when I was an undergraduate student.  I got my graduate degree as well as my undergraduate degree at UC Davis, so that's where I've been for a while: University of California Davis.  And as an undergrad I took a zooarchæology course from Teresa Steele, who would then turn out to be my dissertation advisor, and so I was doing an internship with her.  She was studying the faunal remains from this site Abri Peyrony. And she had me doing really really tedious work: just counting and weighing teeny-tiny little pieces of bone that were like two centimetres or less [1 cm = about 0.39 inch] in size.  And then when I was doing that work I actually found one of these bone tools.  And so then, one thing led to the next: I get to grad school, then I get to study these bone tools, and, well, now here we are.  But, that was like, was it ten?  I guess that was nine years ago when I first started working with Dr Teresa Steele.


((WN))  How many institutes were involved in this research?


((Naomi Martisius))  So, on the paper, I think it lists seven different institutes.  But two of the institutions were the main institutions I would say.  So University of California Davis, where I got my dissertation, where my advisor also is a professor.  But then, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology is where the — for the most part — where the ZooMS analysis was conducted; and then several researchers are also affiliated with the Max Planck Institute.  And then there are some other institutions that some of the other researchers are affiliated with.  But, I would say, the majority of work either happened at UC Davis or at the Max Planck Institute.


((WN))  What activities did this study involve?


((Naomi Martisius))  What activities.  So, the main activities I would say would be the ZooMS analysis; the zooarchæological analysis, or the study of the fauna; and then the statistical analyses.  But in addition to those, I mean there's so many different things that are involved in a study like this, things that happened even before we started doing the study: just having to excavate the site, and gather the artefacts, and wash them, and various things like that.  But then also, you know, writing, and brainstorming, and emailing colleagues, and data organisation; there's all sorts of different things that [go] on.


((WN))  What was the timeline of this study?


((Naomi Martisius))  Yeah.  It's even hard for me to remember right now actually [laughs].  But I think when we first decided to do a study like this, it would have been back in 2017.  And then from there, I think some of the first results were obtained at the end of 2017.  — When I say results, I mean the first ZooMS results were obtained at the end of 2017.  And that's when I started comparing the ZooMS results to the rest of the fauna at the site: which species of fauna [were] found at the site.  Not all of the bone tools had ZooMS results right away.  So that, trying to get more ZooMS results took several tries, several more months, and then I think by the end of 2018, we had a solid draft about ready to submit for publication.  But then; well, this is getting into a whole lot of other things.  But anyway, we had to then collect more data.  We decided to generate more ZooMS data on just the fauna from the site, to compare the results: non-destructive results from the fauna, to the morphological identifications to see if those were corroborated.  And so that was mostly done in 2019.  And then at the end of 2019, we had... pretty much our final draft — or, near-final draft — of the paper [ready] to go before it was submitted for publication.  So anyway, several years.


((WN))  What were the roles of other people involved in the study?


((Naomi Martisius))  So: there were, um, three researchers on this study.  The last three listed on the paper — Teresa Steele, Shannon McPherron, and Marie Soressi — they're all my dissertation advisors.  I already mentioned Teresa Steele as my main dissertation adviser but the two other, also, [were] external advisors for me.  And they helped a lot in constructing the design of the research.  So that was a big role that they played there.


Frido Welker: I think it says right at the top of the paper that he contributed equally to this research as I did.  So Frido is the ZooMS expert on this paper: so I'm not. [...] I'm the bone tool expert, and Frido Walker is the ZooMS expert.  So he did the initial ZooMS analyses.  And then he also got one of his grad students involved — Virginie Sinet-Mathiot — and she did some subsequent ZooMS analyses.  And then they also had someone named Arndt Wilcke, I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right, he also helped with some of the ZooMS analyses.  And then, Tamara; and I always say her last name wrong; Dogandžić, I think.  She was one of the archæoologists at Abri Peyrony: so she helped with context — site context — where these bone tools came from, in the site.  And then, William Rendu worked at the Pech-de-l’Azé I site.  So he helped with context there, and the fauna there.  And then, did I miss anyone?  Oh!  Mark Grote!  He was a very important person on this paper.  He was the statistician.  And so I worked closely with him doing the statistical analysis.  I think I got everyone.


((WN))  Which activity took the most time and attention?


((Naomi Martisius))   Which activity took the most time?  And attention. Um.  I mean this might not be the answer you were looking for, but probably just coordinating everyone's schedules. [laughs] And getting everyone on the same track.  Yeah.  I mean, actually when you go and do something: one thing doesn't necessarily take all that long.  But then, it builds up to taking a lot of time altogether.


((WN))  What was the most difficult part of the study?


((Naomi Martisius))  The most.  Difficult.  Part.  Um.  [pause]  Well, I think it would probably have to do with validating our results.  So since we conducted a non-destructive study, then that brings in the big issue: how do we know that our results are actually what we say they are.  Since it's non-destructive, were we even testing something that came from the bone.  So really really conducting a lot of separate analyses to make sure samples weren't contaminated and making sure that our results were actually coming from the bones: I think that was probably the most difficult part.


((WN))  How long did it take to conduct the research?


((Naomi Martisius))   Well, like I said, we started back in 2017.  So, with all the various aspects put together, it's probably two and a half years.  But then, like I said in a previous question, there's a lot of things that happened even before we decided to do this study.  So I don't know; it depends [laughs] exactly what you're asking.


((WN))  Were you anticipating this outcome?


((Naomi Martisius))   Um.  Yeah, that's a good question.  Because — So these bone tools were found before I was even involved in this study, or, some of the bones were, right? I told you that I found one — actually found two — myself.  But some of these other ones were found before I was even involved.  And I think that the general consensus of the researchers at that time was that these probably came from medium-sized ungulates.  Ungulates would be hooved animals.  So like a deer.  And that really had to do with the size of these bone tools: they were pretty small and worn down.  But, once I started studying; and I'd looked at a lot of these similar types of bone tools from other contexts — not that were made and used by Neandertals, but that were made and used by people like you and me in more recent time periods.  And after looking at those, I had an inkling that they were actually larger bovids — some sort of large bovids — but I couldn't prove it.  Just, that's what I figured at that point.  And so, it was just exciting to see that I predicted it correctly, even though I didn't say it anywhere in publication or anything but just in my mind — that's what I thought it was.


((WN))  What was the most fascinating aspect of this study?


((Naomi Martisius))  So.  For me it is, like, truly fascinating that we can test plastic that once touched a bone.  And so there is this transfer of collagen from the bone to the plastic: and so we can get this result — get the collagen off of the plastic — so that's just like — when I first even heard about the idea, considered doing it, it just seemed fantastical to me.  So, that was really cool.


((WN))  What were the challenges that the team faced during the research?


((Naomi Martisius))  Actually I think I've mentioned this in one of those previous questions, but: I think the main challenge had to do with validating our results.  And just proving that our results are what we say they are.


((WN))  How frequently did the Neanderthals used bones to manufacture tools?


((Naomi Martisius))  So, in general, when Neandertals were living in Europe, and in the Near East, they didn't use very many bone tools; or at least they don't preserve well, or if they were using bone tools, the evidence of it is pretty hard to come by, so it's kind of hard to say if they were using bone tools.  So the most common type of bone tools that they used were these bone fragments that they then used to sharpen the edge of a stone tool.  We call those retouchers.  So I would say they used those fairly frequently.  Because they were using stone tools a lot.  We find lots and lots of stone tools in the archæoological record.  And so, they need to sharpen their stone tools somehow, so often they did use bone to sharpen them.  So that type of bone tool would be considered an opportunistic bone tool: you just pick up a piece of bone and use it.  But, the type of bone tool that was in this study — I don't even think I've said the name yet — lissoirs, which means ""smoother"".  Those were extremely uncommon; and so far they've only been found at a handful of sites.  And I think there are some other bone tools that Neandertals used in later time periods, so the latest Neandertals before they go extinct.  But I would say for the most part they don't seem to be using, or they didn't seem to be using bone tools very frequently.


((WN))  You mentioned the bones were obtained from two different sites.  Geographically, how far were these sites located from each other?


((Naomi Martisius))  They're about 35 kilometres [almost 22 miles] away in this nice little quaint region of the southwest of France, on different tributaries of a river [the Dordogne] in the southwest of France.


((WN))  What do we know about the history of these sites and the bone tools?


((Naomi Martisius))  So.  Both these sites were actually excavated several times.  The Pech-de-l’Azé site is actually a complex of sites; so this one is Pech-de-l’Azé I, and I believe they have II, III, IV, and V.  I'm not sure if they all have archæology found at them.  Yes, I'd have to go back and look at the literature about that.  But I know the Pech-de-l’Azé complex of sites was excavated over a hundred years ago.  And I know back in 1909, there was the remains of a Neandertal child found.  So that's probably what that site is most famous for.  And then, the other site Abri Peyrony is again, a site in a complex of sites.  But the complex there is called the Combe-Capelle sites.  I think it was originally published back in 1925; the first excavations would have happened a few years before that.  And then it was re-excavated in the 90s, and then again in — around 2010.  Maybe 2009–11, something like that.  And that was the most recent excavation there.


((WN))  How old are the tools that you and your team studied?


((Naomi Martisius))  So, these bone tools are about the same age at both sites: about 50 thousand years old.


((WN))  How did you obtain those specimens?


((Naomi Martisius))   How did we obtain them.  Well, so they were found either during excavation on-site, or they were found after excavation when all the artefacts were being cleaned.  Once we excavate a site, we collect them all, we tag them all, and then they go with the rest of the collection.  But because they were potential bone tools, they were kept aside, and then I just needed permission from the two PIs on these two different sites.  And so, the two PIs were; I mentioned them earlier; Shannon McPherron — when I say PI: principal investigator — Shannon McPherron is the PI on Abri Peyrony.  And Marie Soressi is the PI for Pech-de-l’Azé I.


((WN))  You mentioned the result from one of the sites did not give any positive results.  What could be the reason for that?


((Naomi Martisius))  So, most of the time, it has to do with just collagen preservation.  So that particular bone likely did not have enough collagen left in it to then test.  I guess I can't say that with 100% confidence because we didn't destructively sample that one.  Maybe we would have had result if we actually destructively sampled it.  We just did the non-destructive method and we couldn't get results.  So, chances are it did have less collagen than the other ones.


((WN))  What do we know about lissoirs?  And do we know how neanderthals manufactured lissoirs?


((Naomi Martisius))   So, lissoir: we can say that's the typological — type of tool.  So it's a category of tool that Neandertals made and used.  This particular category of tool was actually found in archæoological sites that are a little younger than these Neandertal sites.  So it was known for a very long time in some of these other sites made by Homo sapiens — so not Neandertals: Homo sapiens, people like me and you.  So in general, what we know about lissoirs is that they're these elongated pieces of bones — often made on ribs, but not always, sometimes they're made on the long bone of an animal, like a leg bone of an animal.  But most often they're made on ribs.  And they have this rounded distal working end that often exhibits polish.  So these Neandertal-made ones, found at this Neandertal site, fits really well into this category [with] these other ones used by Homo sapiens in subsequent time periods.  And we know that they were manufactured because if you use a microscope to look at the surface of these bone tools you will see striations — parallel striations — at the tip of the tools, and along the edges of the tools that are consistent with scraping and grinding against a stone tool.  So a stone tool would have been used to shape the end of it.


((WN))  How did you confirm the lissoir was used for working animal skin to leather?


((Naomi Martisius))  So.  There was a study back in 2013 that I was actually a co-author on, but I hadn't done any of the analyses on the bone tools yet at that point.  There were other people doing the analyses on the bone tools at that point.  And so, one of the co-authors on that paper, back in 2013, that was published in PNAS, did what they call a use-wear of microwear analysis on the Pech-de-l’Azé I piece.  And so, she used a high-powered microscope and compared the microtopography of the bone tool to a microtopography of an experimental tool that was used on leather.  And they looked very very similar.  So in general, the changes that happen to the surface of the bone looked very very consistent with use on something soft and supple like leather.  And then, since 2013, for my dissertation I have done a very similar study myself and would say for the most part the other tools look pretty similar.  Yeah.  That stuff isn't published yet.  But hopefully, it will be published soon.


((WN))  Do we know how Neanderthals used the leather?


((Naomi Martisius))  Um, no.  And that would be really really difficult to get it.


I imagine it was used as clothing.  And probably even footwear.  Maybe turned into shoes of some sort.  This clothing and footwear would be pretty simple.  We know they didn't have anything sophisticated, like needles for sewing anything tailored.  But probably some sort of clothing, I would say.


But the leather probably was used for other things as well, like you know: you could make a bag out of it.  Or you could use it as shelter over a cave opening or something.  Um, a blanket yeah, when they were sleeping.  There's probably all sorts of different uses.


((WN))  Which technologies were used for the study?


((Naomi Martisius))  So do you mean specifically to study the artefacts?  Technologies on the artefacts?


((WN))  Yes.


((Naomi Martisius))  For this study I would say no, it was just the ZooMS that was done on the artefacts.


((WN))  Could you briefly explain how ZooMS technology works?


((Naomi Martisius))  Sure.  ZooMS analyses the collagen from ancient bones.  Collagen is an organic protein that degrades over time;  so depending how well this collagen is preserved, in this archæological bone, you may or may not have enough collagen to study.  But then, if you do have enough collagen — ZooMS can basically be used as a chemical fingerprint to identify a species that the bones came from.


So the collagen gets broken down into peptide components.  And depending on which peptides are there — you can sort of think of it like DNA when you have certain genes there: the presence of a gene means something — in ZooMS the presence of a particular protein, or the combination of a couple different proteins, means it belongs to a certain animal.  So, if you just have one protein present, you know, it might be kind of difficult to say what animal it came from; but the more you have, then you can be more confident in what animal, or type of animal it's coming from.


((WN))  What were the advantages of using bones from bovine animals over reindeer's?


((Naomi Martisius))  So, I think it mostly has to do with the size.  These large bovids are definitely larger than reindeer.  Reindeer actually have pretty thin and flimsy ribs.  And large bovids like cattle, or bison, they have really really robust ribs.  And so, they're thicker, they're stronger, and they're gonna be more resistant to breaking during flexion.  And probably the action of using this tool would cause it to bend under pressure.  And so when you have this thicker rib, then there's less chance that it's gonna break during use.


((WN))  Apart from the strength, how do the rib bones of bovines differ from those of reindeers?


((Naomi Martisius))  I guess they'd be a little longer as well.  I mean it's a bigger animal so they're gonna be longer.  The morphology is probably gonna be slightly different.  I would say, in general, ungulates — I mentioned that term before: hoofed animals — they have pretty similar rib morphologies: flatter ribs.  If you just had a piece of the rib on the side of the animal, then you might not be able to tell what it came from.  But if you have a piece preserved, like the head of the rib, or near the vertebral articulation of the rib, there will be some slight morphological differences, where you'd be able to tell what animal it came from.


((WN))  Did the Neanderthals use reindeer bones for some other purposes?


((Naomi Martisius))  As far as we know, they weren't used for specific purposes.  I mentioned the retouchers before: bones just used to sharpen a lithic edge.  I'm sure there were lots and lots reindeer rib — not ribs — but reindeer leg bones used to resharpen stone tools.  But those probably weren't selected for a specific purpose.  That was just 'cause it was there to use.


((WN))  Does this imply Neanderthals were inclined [towards] using bones from one species or the other?


((Naomi Martisius))  So, I think there would need to be more research to say something like that.  But in my opinion, I don't think so.  I think it has more to do with the size of the animal, in their environment, at that time, these large bovids were the larger animals on the landscape.  So I think that's why they used those ribs, as opposed to the reindeer, or something else that was more abundant.  Yeah.


((WN))  How did you make sure this available data is not survivor's bias?


((Naomi Martisius))  Yeah.  Okay.  So I suppose it could be, an issue of preservation: the only ones that happen to be preserved were the larger bovid bones.


I suppose that could be an issue.  But we did look at all of the fauna from the site and specifically looked at all the ribs from the site as well.  And there are plenty of rib fragments from reindeer, or from smaller species and those do not seem to be preserved any less frequently than the large bovid ribs.  So I don't think that is an issue at the site.


((WN))  ZooMS usually involve drilling the artefacts.  How did your team come to the idea that you would rather use the collagen stuck to the walls of the containers?


((Naomi Martisius))  The inspiration for the analysis was really from another team that did it first.  I was at a conference in 2017, and I saw that another team had done this.  And I talked to my colleagues, and we decided that we would try this on our bone tools too.


((WN))  For how long were these bone tools exposed to the plastic containers?


((Naomi Martisius))  It was various amounts of time depending, well, depending on a number of things, how long the artefacts had been found; what they had been curated in before — because not all of them were curated in something plastic beforehand, but most of the Abri Peyrony ones were sitting in a plastic box for about five years.  One of them had been found more recently, and it was only in its plastic box for about two months.  And then, we tested the Pech[-de-l’Azé] one after it had been in a plastic bag for about five months.


((WN))  Has this type of non-destructive ZooMS been used for studying bones and artefacts dating back millennia?


((Naomi Martisius))  Not back millennia.  I mentioned this other team, who did it first, and they did it non-destructively on Iroquoian bone tools: so that would be a couple hundred years old.  But so far this particular type of non-destructive ZooMS hadn't been done on anything older.


((WN))  How did the team make sure the samples gathered from the walls of these containers were not contaminated?


((Naomi Martisius))  So.  As I mentioned before, validating our results and ruling out contamination: it was a big issue for us.  And so we took lots and lots of different measures to do this.  And in the paper, we mentioned seven different ways, how we did this.  When you run the ZooMS samples, you always leave a sample blank.  So, one where you don't have any collagen in it.  If you get results at the end, and there is some sort of collagen, then you know your samples are all contaminated.  But that one was blank, so that was good.  We also tested the empty boxes — similar boxes that never held any archæoological specimens before — those came back empty of any collagen as well.  Next, we tested the washing water that artefacts — when we excavate, they're covered in dirt, most of the time.  So we always wash them to get this dirt off.  And, especially for the teeny tiny bone fragments, those get washed together, because they're all in a bag together; they're really teeny tiny, less than two centimetres; small pieces.  So those get washed together in the little water bath.  And then we tested that water to see if any collagen was contaminating the water, or if there could be any chance of cross-contamination during this washing process.  So then, the third way was — well, when we were doing the identifications, all the IDs came back as one animal.  If it was contaminated you would have IDs that didn't make sense, you know?  Like proteins popping up from, you know, not just these large bovids, but also reindeer, something else in there.  Then, the next way was to look to see if there were any peptides from hæmoglobin, or from keratin.  And there wasn't anything like that, so we ruled out any contamination from the skins that may have been worked by these tools.  And then, two more ways that we did.  Since we didn't want to destroy these objects, we couldn't confirm our results destructively.  So we got a sample from the other fauna at the site.  Most of those we had good morphological identifications on, identifications based on morphology; we can say, ""yes this piece is a reindeer; we know that.  100% certainty.""  And we also did destructive ZooMS as well as non-destructive ZooMS, and — that didn't always work; sometimes we didn't get results at all; but when we did get positive results, for the most part it was all confirming each other.  And then, the last way that we ruled out contamination was, we looked at the deamidation calculations of the collagen, and it showed that the collagen was degraded and therefore ancient.  So, then we were able to rule out modern contaminants in there as well.


((WN))  Do we know which animals that Neanderthals used for making leather?


((Naomi Martisius))  No.  Not at all.  We don't know that at all.


((WN))  Is it possible the bones [which] were from different locations gave different results because of the contamination?  As you mentioned one of the sites didn't give any positive results.  Could it be possible because it was contaminated?


((Naomi Martisius))  No, if it was contaminated, then we would have some other results.  We just, we didn't have any results.  That wouldn't be related to contamination.


((WN))  How did you make sure that everything was pointing back to the same result, provided the number of specimens were not that much?


((Naomi Martisius))  Mm.  Yeah, so sample size is always gonna be an issue in archæology.  It is.  So anybody who's reading the paper is gonna have to take the results, I guess, with a grain of salt.  Because when you start adding more and more samples, maybe the results will start to change.  But just based on the samples that we have, they were all one thing and I mean, I think that's fairly good results for a small sample size.


((WN))  In your blog post about this research, you had mentioned Neanderthals ""did not necessarily manufacture bones into specific objects"".  What could be the reason?  And can you please explain that?


((Naomi Martisius))  Yeah, so I think when I said that in the blog post, I was thinking about those retouchers that I mentioned earlier.  So they are just the bones that you'd pick up and use to sharpen a stone tool.  So those bones don't need to be shaped into any particular object.  Those bones are just used the way they are to do a very particular task.  And for the most part, Neandertals — they didn't really make many other bone tools.  And that's what we find in the archæoological record: for most of the time Neandertals were alive, hardly any bone tools [are] found from their archæoological sites.  And the reason for that — lots of people have different reasons for this.  Some people say ""oh it's because Neandertals couldn't make bone tools"".   But now we know with these lissoirs that they [could] — they did shape them into somehting to use them.  Also, at very very few sites some of the latest Neandertals that ever lived did make some other bone tools.  So they definitely were able to make bone tools.  But why they didn't make them all the time: that's something harder to get at.  Maybe they just didn't need them for their specific purposes.


((WN))  What does this tell us about their behaviour?


((Naomi Martisius))  Wait; what specifically?


((WN))  The process that Neanderthals follow for making tools from bones — what does that tell us about the behaviour?


((Naomi Martisius))  So do you specifically mean these ones?  The lissoirs from this study?


((WN))  [Nods].


((Naomi Martisius))  Okay.  Well, it tells me that they knew what they were doing.  They had a clear idea about what type of bone in a certain type of animal would work for a certain purpose.  So they obviously had a lot of forethought.  And they really understood the raw material properties of the particular tools that they were using.


((WN))  In your career, you had previously worked on a study which stated Neanderthals used sophisticated tools made of bone before humans ever did.  Could you tell us more about it?


((Naomi Martisius))  Yeah, so I believe you're referring to the 2013 study from PNAS.  These are the same bone tools.  It's just, that paper described the discovery of these tools, and this current paper is describing one particular aspect: the raw material selection of these tools.  I guess I just want to comment on that question a little bit.  It's not [just] that they made these tools — they made them before humans were making them in Europe; because Neandertals were in Europe before humans migrated into Europe.  So that was the main thing about that.


((WN))  So you used the same artefacts for that research as well?


((Naomi Martisius))  Yes.  The same artefacts.  And then, I found an additional one during my dissertation studies.


((WN))  So what are the inferences of this study?


((Naomi Martisius))  Well, I think I probably said it a couple times now: Neandertals were definitely selective in their raw material for making these bone tools; and this selection really shows that they had knowledge of the raw material properties of these ribs and knew what they wanted for their particular tasks.


((WN))  Are we aware of some other bone tools used for some other purposes by Neanderthals?


((Naomi Martisius))  Well I mentioned the retouchers before.  Those are very very common at Neandertal sites.  So they're not shaped pieces of bone, they're just bone fragments and then you can see by little impact marks on these bones that they were used to sharpen lithic tools.  And then, in just a few sites in southwest France — the technology I guess we can say, is Châtelperronian.  So it would be the very latest latest Neandertals that lived in Europe.  They were making other bone tools then, right before they went extinct.  So they made awls, elongated pointed objects likely for piercing, possibly, animal skins.  They also made some pendants made out of animal teeth, possibly worn as jewellery or something like that.  But that was very very rare, only found at a very small number of sites, and even that is controversial.  Not everyone actually believes that Neandertals made those.  Yeah; there's been debate about that.


((WN))  Are there any downsides of using a non-destructive ZooMS procedure?


((Naomi Martisius))  So, I would say the main downside would be that your results might be ambiguous, or maybe you don't even get results at all.  Your results are definitely going to be better using the destructive methods.


((WN))  What does the success of this study mean for the future of archæology, especially for using non-destructive ZooMS procedure?


((Naomi Martisius))  Oh, I think a lot of researchers are probably gonna be pretty excited about this.  Because now, there's the possibility to test all sorts of precious artefacts that nobody ever wanted to sample before.  And so now we can at least try to sample these artefacts and see if we can get some results for that.


((WN))  Are there any future plans to explore more about the preferences of Neanderthals from other sites, or maybe some other peculiar habits they had?


((Naomi Martisius))  So, if you're speaking of bone tools specifically, I would say: I don't have any specific plans at this moment, but I would love to keep doing that, if there are more bone tools to study in this way.  I would love to do a study on the retouchers that I mentioned several times now, to see if there was some sort of preference with those.  There are plenty of other researchers out there,  working on raw material selection in Neandertals, but on stone.  So for the most part, what we find in the archæoological record, especially in Neandertal times, is a bunch of stone tools.  And so there's actually been lots and lots of research on what Neandertals were using for their stone tools.


((WN))  What lies ahead in this field of study?


((Naomi Martisius))  I think there needs to be a lot more experimental work done.  If you look at all of our results, including the fauna from the two sites, a lot of the pieces didn't have any positive results at all.  We had a lot of empty spectra.  So, trying to figure out how this actually works, I guess [laughs], that's a big thing.  In what circumstances, and using which plastics — because there are different types of plastics, and maybe certain plastics pull the collagen out of the bone better and stick to the plastic better.  So there's all sorts of different experimental things that can be done.  Working on the plastic; various lengths of time; touching the plastic; if it's rubbing on plastic in a particular way.  Yeah, there's various things that can be done with that.


((WN))  What are the other researches you are already working on?


((Naomi Martisius))  I guess the main thing that I'm working on right now, I actually just started as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany; although I'm in California right now.  But I will get over to Leipzig as soon as the world starts opening up again.  But my main reason for being hired by them to work in Leipzig is to study the bone artefacts from a site called Bacho Kiro in Bulgaria.  And I was actually in Bulgaria for five months, starting in October, studying the bone artefacts there as well as animal teeth pendants.  And then I went back to California because I was in Bulgaria on a Fulbright fellowship that ended; but then, I'm gonna try to get back to Europe to continue that study.  So that's the main thing I've been working on, I would say.


((WN))  What was your role at the UC Davis?


((Naomi Martisius))  So, for the past: well, starting in 2012 — I guess it was — 2012 to 2019, I was a graduate student.  I obtained my PhD last year, and I'm still an associate researcher for UC Davis.  So I still have all my connections there; and I will retain the status of associate researcher for the next couple years.


((WN))  [Those] were all the questions I had for you.  Is there anything you would like to add?


((Naomi Martisius))  Oh!  Is there anything else?  You know, as I was talking, I was thinking, ""oh I should have said this, and that, and the other thing"", but now when you ask me that I can't remember.  [laughs]  I think the main thing I wanted to get across, and maybe I said it a couple times during this talk:  Just thinking about Neandertals:  When Neandertals were living — mostly in Europe, also in the Near East — for a couple hundred thousand years, during this whole time period, they hardly used bone tools.  Or if they did, it was very opportunistically.  They only made a handful of shaped bone tools for specific purposes.  And when they did do that, they were able to do it in a very professional way.  They knew what they were doing; it wasn't just like ""oh let's just try this thing and see what happens"", right?  So, I guess the main thing I would like to impart, to the general public, is: often, in popular media, whatever, Neandertals kind of get a bad rap as these, I don't know, subhuman type of ancient people, but they were very very sophisticated in many many ways.  And with these bone tools, that's just one of the ways.


((WN))  Thank you for agreeing for this discussion.  It was a great pleasure  discussing this with you.


((Naomi Martisius))  Yeah!  Thank you.  I enjoyed it as well.


((WN))  Okay.  Goodbye.  Have a good night.


((Naomi Martisius))  Okay you too.  Have a good day.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Open_source_game_developer_Perttu_Ahola_talks_about_Minetest_with_Wikinews,2020-06-30,Open source game developer Perttu Ahola talks about Minetest with Wikinews,"Recently, Finnish open-source video game developer Perttu Ahola discussed Minetest, his ""longest ever project"", with Wikinews.


Started in October 2010, Minetest was an attempt by Ahola to create a sandbox game similar to Minecraft.  Minecraft is a multi-platform commercial game, which was in alpha version when Ahola challenged himself to create something similar to it from scratch, he told Wikinews.


Minetest is an open-source game, which is free for anyone to download and play. It is written in the C++ programming language, and the source code is available on code-hosting site GitHub.  According to Ahola, Minetest attempts to run on older hardware, with limited graphics, but to be accessible to more people: those who have outdated technology, and making it available for no cost.  Minecraft, on the other hand, is a paid game, currently costing USD 26.95 for its computer version.  Minecraft is currently owned by Microsoft, and performs poorly on older hardware.


A correspondent from French Wikinews contacted Perttu Ahola via Internet Relay Chat a few weeks ago, discussing Minecraft.  This interview is built on top of the previous interview, as we take a deeper dive into knowing more about this free game which is about to turn ten years old in a few months.


Can you introduce yourself?


((Perttu Ahola))   Hi.  Although I'm usually called ""celeron55"" on the Internet, my real name is Perttu Ahola.  I'm a programmer and electronics geek from Finland.


((WN))  How did you find out about programming?


((Perttu Ahola))  I've had programming as a hobby my entire life.  When I was a kid I programmed using BASIC on my dad's computers and at school and university I attended programming courses and learned more languages.


((WN))  What made you want to create Minetest?


((Perttu Ahola))  Initially I took it as a challenge, but after a year of working on it, it turned into this weird quest of trying to figure out what can be done with it that Mojang (now Microsoft) won't do.  But initially it was the challenge, and the mystery of how a game world like this works under the hood.


((WN))  When did you start working on Minetest initially?


((Perttu Ahola))  At the beginning of October 2010.


((WN))  How many core-developers were working on the development at that time?


((Perttu Ahola))  Myself only.  Back then it was exactly what the name implies.  The first contributor appeared six months after.


((WN))  When was Minetest first available to public?


((Perttu Ahola))  It was first published to a private IRC channel for testing, and after about a week I published it on a public programming channel on IRCnet called #ohjelmointiputka.  I created the website sometime during January 2011.


((WN))  How were the initial few months for the game?  How did the userbase respond?  How was it received?


((Perttu Ahola))  The initial userbase was mostly a bunch of hobbyist programmers from that Finnish IRC channel.  Everyone liked messing around in the quirky little multiplayer sandbox that it was.


((WN))  How many core-developers are working on Minetest right now?


((Perttu Ahola))  I need to look this up as much as you do...  Looks like we have 13 at the moment.  It doesn't really correlate with how many people are working on Minetest though, as core developer is primarily a position of trust — they decide what is merged into the upstream repositories.  Some contributors do a lot but aren't core developers.  This goes both ways: Some core developers are quite inactive a lot of the time.


((WN))  Do these trusted core-developers have specific roles?


((Perttu Ahola))  They used to have, but [it] didn't work very well.  Nowadays everyone is simply responsible of only touching things they know about.


((WN))  What are you learning from them and what are they learning from you?


((Perttu Ahola))  During the first years I learned a lot about programming.  Some of it came from others but mostly it was just because I did it so much myself.  Later I've learned some things about management as I had to move from programming more into a leadership role.  Many young people have come and gone from the project as their life has moved on — I'm sure they've learned something from it.


((WN))  Tell us more about your workflow.


((Perttu Ahola))  Historically when making most of my development contribution in Minetest, or currently?


((WN))  Tell me about both the times, please.


((Perttu Ahola))  Well there's not much to talk about my current workflow, as I'm mainly doing web-hosting and administration, being an encyclopædia about the code and design of the project, assigning core developer, moderator and other roles to people, and just managing the odd weird things that sometimes happen that contributors and core developers can't handle.


When I was programming Minetest in the first many years, and these days in other development projects, my workflow is just to allocate as much continuous time that I possibly can for a task that I want to do, then just begin designing and writing a prototype and iteratively forming it into a final implementation.  The only distinct step in between starting and finishing is the first time it runs and does the bare minimum.


I don't want to boast about it, but people have commented about my ability to solo develop things really fast from nothing into usable state.  There's no method to it.  I just make sure I have the time, I know what the bare minimum is and then I just get to it.


((WN))  Have there been any significant changes in the game or source code in the history of Minetest?


((Perttu Ahola))  It was developed in a very iterative manner.  We've never had to throw away any big parts.  Maybe iterative isn't the best word, I mean it was always developed by building on what was previously created.  Actually we've had one big change, although it too was an addition: When we went from version 0.3 to 0.4, Minetest gained its Lua-based modding API.  It was a really big change in how people thought about and used Minetest.


((WN))  What are the different ways to participate?


((Perttu Ahola))  Many of our users like to write mods, big and small, and publish them on our forum and content database.  If you're more of a C++ person, our GitHub and IRC channels are good places to check out.  If you feel like a server administrator, you could set up a Minetest server with an interesting world for people to join in.


If you find something interesting in the game world while playing or experimenting, we have a popular screenshot thread on our forums that you can post to.  It shows almost the entire history of the project and I still like browsing it.  But I think the best part of Minetest is that it sets people free to do their own thing.  You don't need to ask us or anyone to use Minetest for anything you would like.  Use it to learn programming, use it as a teacher, use it to model an environment, geographical formations, a mathematical formula or an electronic principle, use it to prototype a multiplayer game.  Use it as a way to host a party when in quarantine? I think of it more of as a tool than a game project.


But you're welcome to contribute something that makes it better.  It is a project at multiple levels, so pick a level that you're comfortable in.


((WN))  Can you give us some figures on Minetest?


((Perttu Ahola))  We don't really keep track of our userbase in any centralized manner, so I don't have any numbers to give unless I go about digging for them.  It's difficult to figure out how many installs of Minetest there are when it's packaged in so many Linux distributions that I can't even count those reliably.  There are also endless forks to be found, especially on mobile platforms, even though we do publish an official Android version.


((WN))  What are the tools you use for the development of Minetest?


((Perttu Ahola))  Vim, bash and some common command-line utilities like grep, sed, screen.  Git of course.  Sometimes python scripts.  Minetest uses the CMake build system which is simple to use from the command-line.  All in all just the bread and butter Linux command-line environment, with my personal customization of course.


I don't really like complex slow IDEs [Integrated Development Environments], they get in the way and create new problems that you shouldn't have to deal with.


((WN))  How do you track the progress of the development?


((Perttu Ahola))  Currently, or when I started the project?  In any case the answer pretty much is I don't.  Things develop as they do and nobody likes being pushed when they're doing it as a hobby for free.  We use a release process where when enough new features have been added, there is a feature-freeze where only bugfixes are allowed, and then a release.  It's the bare minimum to keep things rolling smoothly in a large project like this.  We have long wishlists and roadmaps, but in the end what features get developed gets chosen by whoever's putting in the work, as long as whatever they want to do fits the project.


Well, we of course have an issue list and PR [pull request] list on GitHub.  I tend to take that for granted these days.


There are multiple levels you can track development in — issues and pull requests are at the bottom just above commits.  You could be tracking roadmaps or minimum viable products or such, but we use a relatively chaotic model if you compare it to a company developing a product for a market.


((WN))  How rigorously is the software tested?


((Perttu Ahola))  There are unit tests for some easily testable portions, and there's a CI [Continuous Integration] server that checks whether the project builds on a couple of platforms and whether the tests pass.  In addition to developers many of our users are using the development version which helps us catch bugs before they end up in a release, making releases reasonably stable.  How rigorously?  Well, you could do more or less, but this seems to balance the effort and the end result.


((WN))  Have there ever been critical bugs in the releases, or severe security breaches?


((Perttu Ahola))  That depends on your criteria.  Nothing that would've made the news.  And nothing that I would really remember.  Something allowing in-game cheating on a multiplayer server, sure.  Something that would have irreversibly corrupted a player's game world, not in a stable release.  Something that would have prevented the game from starting on some platform, sure of course.  Something worthy of a remote code execution CVE [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]?  Well not really, but that can be just because not enough resources are put into finding out if there are any.  Not that we have any resources for that.  Contributions welcome!


((WN))  What are the key selling points of Minetest?  As I understand, Minetest is not just a game, and you can do more with it.  What are some of the fascinating use cases you have seen people use Minetest for?


((Perttu Ahola))  It's so many things to so many people.  The basic premise is, it implements a cubic voxel world which is played in the first or third person perspective, either locally or on a multiplayer server.  In the default game there's a sandbox or a survival-ish scenario where you can build stuff from familiar materials, and a world generator that creates a natural landscape.


But hooks have been added to it where you can add or remove content to your liking (these pluggable modifications are called ""mods"" by the engine), and the community has used these over the years to create different kinds of above- and underground landscapes that can either be just explored or used as the backdrop for whatever you're doing, logical systems resembling electronics or mechanics, programmable blocks, sets of animals with different design goals, some vehicles (although the engine isn't quite up to snuff for those), trains, multiplayer economics, some RPG [role-playing game] elements, weapons, things designed for education, and whatnot.  Those are combined in multiplayer worlds on servers to something much more than the sums of their parts.


And often the enjoyment is as much in the making of a mod as it is in using the end result.  It's an outdated idea that you implement a feature to use it.  Minetest can be enjoyed as much inside a text editor as it can be enjoyed by controlling the player character in the game.  It's actually interesting also that the fact that it is a multiplayer sandbox environment makes it fun in itself due to human nature.  I proved it with the initial versions that had like 3 block types and zero game elements or limits other than basic gravity.  You get these layers of creativity: There's creativity in the making of Minetest, there's creativity in making a mod, there's creativity in making a world, there's creativity in the playing itself.


If you like messing around in open-ended development and gameplay, Minetest is for you.  If you need an end goal and a set path, some specific mods or servers could give you those.  I mean, one could write a book about this.  It's the question Minetest asked that Minetest has been answering.


((WN))  What are the main features that differentiate Minetest from Minecraft?


((Perttu Ahola))  Minetest has a simple base game that might seem like the exact same thing.  However, under the hood Minetest is open source, has a modding API, runs on older hardware, supports more platforms and is free to download.  The community has released many kinds of games that run on Minetest and in fact the project is very much based on the community.


((WN))  Tell us more about Minetest's modding API.


((Perttu Ahola))  Technically the modding API is a Lua interpreter integrated into the Minetest engine, which runs Lua in an environment to which most of the game content and engine features are provided by the engine.  There is a simple format for bundling code, textures, sounds and other data to form a thing called ""mod"".  Users can install them and enable them for the game worlds they create.


Mods also create their own APIs that other mods can interface to, and the engine implements a dependency model to facilitate this.  Some game content is grouped into groups so that handling similar items by mods that don't know about the specifics can handle them in reasonable ways.  Say, if you add a new kind of tree formed from its special blocks, they can be marked as being wood or so, and then you can use them as fuel in most cooking or such devices no matter who created them.


There is a mechanism for bundling mods into modpacks to easily bundle related mods together, and there is a concept called ""game"" which is kind of a stand-alone modpack.  The game Minetest comes with is just one of those, and if you install more, you can choose between them in the menu.


((WN))  Why was Lua chosen for the API?  What are some of the advantages of using Lua?


((Perttu Ahola))  Lua is simple but effective, and designed for embedding.  It's also easy to sandbox.  Not many languages actually are designed for embedding, and some of those aren't simple.  For example, [Google Chrome's] V8 is complex and its API is changing all the time, and Python isn't really designed for embedding, it's more of a host language and messes with your locale settings and whatnot, and is quite slow.


There's also LuaJIT, which is a JIT [Just-in-time] compiled version of Lua.  Minetest is able to use it and as such usually Minetest is built with it, as it's faster.  Lua also has a track record in games, although that doesn't matter much in practice.


((WN))  What are some of the Minetest features that are extremely popular among the users?


((Perttu Ahola))  How do I know?  Well, I mean, placing blocks probably, I'm pretty sure everyone does that.  More seriously what Minetest does that Minecraft don't is that for the vast majority of servers you don't have to modify your client at all, regardless of mods used on the server.  The client downloads what it needs from the server and custom code runs on the server.  The user of course doesn't need to do anything to make this happen so everyone is automatically using it and it is quite a defining feature.


Modding, of course, is an extremely popular feature — Minetest wouldn't be what it is without mods.  I'd say extremely popular is also the fact that Minetest's mobile versions use the same protocol and code as the desktop version.  I don't think most users appreciate it, but some do.  It brings you all the power regardless of the device.


Well, one Minetest feature is definitely also the license, being LGPL [GNU Lesser General Public License] 2.1.  It has allowed many more and less appreciated developers to publish their own versions of it.  This has happened on all the mobile app stores, those are full of Minetest forks with awful advertising and in-app purchase schemes.  To me it's funny and definitely something that those shady developers appreciate, to users who have fallen for them it's probably quite painful.


((WN))  When was the last time you played Minecraft?


((Perttu Ahola))  I don't remember, certainly not once after 2014 as I don't have it on this computer.  It quickly grew too slow on the previous computer on which I started developing Minetest.  In the alpha days [of Minecraft] it was capable of running on it, these days not a chance.


((WN))  What are some of the features in Minecraft that you hear about, which aren't currently in Minetest?


((Perttu Ahola))  I rarely hear about Minecraft and even then it's about some server and not about features.  At one point every place was full of all kinds of Minecraft mods, but nowadays you have to go look for them to find them.


((WN))  Actually, what position do you hold in the Minetest development?


((Perttu Ahola))  For the past years I've been doing the positions that are the most difficult to fill for contributors: Being the ""CEO"" [Chief Executive Officer] of the project, and doing part of the web hosting, mostly the message board and overseeing the use of *.minetest.net subdomains.  Basically just overseeing things and making sure things that people don't like to do don't turn into disasters.  Sometimes I help with technical details of the engine that people don't always fully understand.


((WN))  What are some of the things you really like about your work?


((Perttu Ahola))  I like how robust Minetest is.  It's based on proven technology that are kind of outdated, but that makes it easily compile and run almost anywhere, and as it's also free, it spreads and sticks like some goo.  It's also small and low maintenance, which I like in anything I do.


I also like that it explores what can be done in the game or application category it's in, in an unusual way (like outside the box of gameplay itself).


((WN))  Do you do this full-time?  Or do you have any other job?


((Perttu Ahola))  Even though the first year or two things were quite hectic I've never done this full time.  It doesn't really make any money.


((WN))  Ah, so you do have other job, too, right?


((Perttu Ahola))  Yeah, I've had a number of jobs during this time.


((WN))  How does the game development receive financial support?


((Perttu Ahola))  I get some donations or ""tips"" as I like to call them, which generally cover the hosting costs of the website and not much more.  Other than that, there has never been any money involved.  In addition to myself some modders and developers also collect some miniscule amounts of donations.


I guess development is mostly supported by being able to slap it onto your CV [Curriculum Vitæ] and get a better job that way.  I guess it's a bit sad.  Or résume for Americans, of course.


""Hi, my hobby is taking over the world from Microsoft.  What's yours?""  Well it's a bit of a joke of me introducing myself and Minetest.  And the absolute craziness of doing it for no monetary gain at all.


((WN))   Yeah; but some sort of donation is needed for running the servers, hosting the wiki, and the domain names, right?


((Perttu Ahola))  It's not required, but I'm fortunate enough to get enough donations to not [have] to pay them out of my own pocket.


((WN))  How does a typical day as the core-developer look like?


((Perttu Ahola))  The core-developer?


((WN))  Since you are one of the core-developers of the game, how does your typical day as the core-developer of this open-source game look like?


((Perttu Ahola))  Currently, as I'm focusing on some other programming projects outside of Minetest, when I have some free time I still check the Minetest IRC channels and GitHub to see what's going on, and if I have something to say I'll make a comment about it.  Of course I check my emails to see if any automated system has sent me a warning about something and needs fixing, or maybe there's a private message on the forum about some administrative task that needs doing.  I might check some system statistics on the VPS [Virtual Private Server] running the forum to make sure it's running smoothly and make sure backups look ok.


The average core developer of course doesn't have much of these administrative things to do and can focus on some programming task or just check through pull requests to see if a new contribution needs attention.  For most core developers the typical day is probably a day off, though, as we work on Minetest when we have free time and feel like it.


((WN))  Tell me, what are some of the design decisions that you are not happy about?


((Perttu Ahola))  There are none, all of them were required to get where we are now.  I think you should never blame a design decision that got you somewhere.


((WN))  Okay.  How does the developer team decide on the design-decisions and feature requests for the game?


((Perttu Ahola))  I have written some blog posts and roadmaps about my vision, and the team is free to either pick from there or simply do anything they think is important.  The core team mostly deals with engine things, and feature requests often come from modders.  Dealing with game design feature requests is really difficult so we've tried to move them out of the engine and into the independent game content.  Most features are accepted as long as they're simply and nicely done and it's obvious players or modders will find use for them.


The team will ask from me if they're unsure about something.  It doesn't often happen, but they're free to do it and I take the responsibility in that case.


This also applies if there's a conflict between team members.


((WN))  Conflict between the team members?  How often is there a conflict between team members?  And how do you resolve it?


((Perttu Ahola))  I'm not sure it has ever really happened.  It's not as exciting as it sounds.  But in that case I get to be the dictator.  :-)


((WN))  What accomplishment are you most proud of?


((Perttu Ahola))  I think it's the initial decision to start the project.  Everything is based on that, after all.  Maybe also the fact that probably like 50% of Minecraft clones on Google Play are Minetest forks, many of which are at least slightly illegal.


((WN))  Looking back at the 9–10 years of this project, what are some of the excellent moments/milestones that stand out?


((Perttu Ahola))  The initial 0.4 development in late 2011 and early 2012 was an exciting time.  One of the contributors at the time helped me a lot in getting it done, he was quite capable and enjoyable to work with.  It felt a bit like a ""dream team"".  Some persons in the Minetest team are quite anonymous, including this one — I never learned their real life identity.


There was a take over attempt of the project in 2017 by an individual who until then seemed like a contributor with good intentions.  It was quite the time too.  I don't want to give any publicity to him though, as he's still trying to do it.  I don't know if I'd call it excellent, but it definitely comes to mind as something that happened.


During the past few years Minetest has had some physical presence in Europe.  A couple of core developers and community members organized a stall at the Freenode #live event in 2017 and 2018.


I guess I have to say I'm not that good at remembering milestones though.  I'm sure many people have their own memories about Minetest's history.  Many remember their first server that they played on, for example — my perspective on the other hand is in development.  In development, it's a good thing I don't remember much because that means everything has gone rather smoothly.


((WN))  Have you been to Freenode #live events?


((Perttu Ahola))  I haven't been to Freenode #live.  I don't tend to travel that far, I feel international travel is too much hassle and I'm not a very social person at all.


((WN))  Do you or any of the Minetest developers attend LibrePlanet, FOSDEM or other conferences too?


((Perttu Ahola))  I haven't been following too closely, but as they're open source developers and many live in central Europe, you might stumble upon them in events around there.  They might be in a disguise, though, as they are involved in other projects in addition to Minetest.


Rubenwardy (one of the core developers) has said he wants a Minetest convention and I have to go.  We'll see if that happens, and where if so.


((WN))  Ah, that would be interesting.  Does Rubenwardy have any places in mind?  What do you think of organising it in Helsinki?


((Perttu Ahola))  As most core developers and contributors come from Germany, France, UK and such, I think Helsinki wouldn't make that much sense.


During Minetest's history, there haven't been almost any Finnish developers other than me.  And, given that I live half a thousand kilometers away from Helsinki, it's not exactly my home town either.


It's a very international project.


((WN))  How do you and Minetest benefit from the presence at freenode? Apart from the platform features, do you also benefit from links with members of other channels at Freenode?


((Perttu Ahola))  Freenode doesn't really link projects together, it mostly works as a private platform for discussions for each project.  Of course it's easy to join if you're already on some other Freenode channels, as many open source developers are.


((WN))  Apart from freenode, how do the developers meet with other developers? Do they use online text or video chat, or do they also have meet-ups in-person?


((Perttu Ahola))  I hear people using mostly IRC, Github and the forum.  There's some development talk on the unofficial discord server too.  I rarely hear about IRL meet-ups.  I've only ever met one Minetest contributor who was visiting Oulu with a group to see the midnight sun which happens this time of the year here in the north.


((WN))  What is planned for the next versions?


((Perttu Ahola))  I and many of our core developers have big plans but we're a bit lazy and have many projects going on so it's really up to who has a spare week here and there and what kind of new contributions are coming in.  We have a history of not ending up even close to what the roadmap was telling us to do.  On a weekly basis we do have a continuous flow of fixes and new modding API features going into the engine, so there's always something around the corner.  In addition to that, an interesting place to be on the lookout is the modding sections of our forum.  Those guys get to use much more imagination than the core engine developers.  It's been long in the plans to get more imaginative content into the main Minetest release, but currently it's still kind of boring, so make sure [to] check out the forum and content database.


((WN))  What are some of the upcoming milestones for Minetest?


((Perttu Ahola))  We're moving release by release and including stuff on a when-it's-ready basis.  [Version] 5.3 will be coming out very soon as there are just some bugs left.  It's ended up with 50 commits.  That's mostly bugfixes, but to pick a feature, the ""minimal development test"" game that comes with engine for mod and engine developing purposes has been rethought and overhauled.  What'll end up in 5.4 is still completely open.


In my experience setting any milestones you're not doing yourself is never a good idea in a hobby project — it'll just intimidate people and nothing gets done.  Some developers have big plans, including myself, but they may or may not happen. :-)


((WN))  How is the i18n [internationalisation] support for Minetest?  Do you plan on supporting more languages?


((Perttu Ahola))  There are some challenges due to the fact that Minetest supports multiplayer servers with each client using their own language settings, but if you choose your mods carefully, you can get a single player experience in many, many languages.  You can check out the translation status for different languages at Weblate.  You can also contribute translations right there on that website.  We occasionally update the English versions and occasionally copy the translated texts over to the project to be included in releases.


Many open source projects do it like this, we're no different.  Currently it looks like 11 languages have 90% of texts translated.  More than 90%, I mean.


Of course with game content, especially that which you find separately, your mileage will vary — but the engine translations are enough to configure Minetest and get you into a game world.  It's an ongoing process to try to make everything we can translatable by the community.


((WN))  Okay.  Do you also plan on providing more biomes, or making the current ones more interesting?


((Perttu Ahola))  We've long been in the process of moving the game content out of the engine and away from the core team more to individual game-focused developers, so the default game content has been a bit boring.  However, you don't need to live with it, as it's easily solved: just download some biomes you like into your game.  At this point it's not really even intended to be used as-is.


It's the core idea of Minetest 0.4, and from there on all subsequent versions.  Content is so easy to add and modify that it doesn't really even matter what content you start from.


If you want a fleshed out product with everything in there out of the box, Minetest doesn't really do that.  But you can search on our forums or content database if there's something that would do it for you — some game packages are quite complete.


((WN))  What are some of the reasons people choose Minecraft over Minetest?  What are some of the common complaints you hear about the game?


((Perttu Ahola))  I think most of the time people don't like Minetest because they want a full game that they can just play.  On the other hand other people choose Minetest because they don't want that, they want something they can easily customize.


Some don't like how Minetest looks, to the experienced eye the graphics aren't as polished.  However it does run on older hardware.  People using older hardware often choose Minetest because it works much better.  On the other hand, Minetest can't utilize high end gaming PCs as well, it's not optimized for those.


Of course also the price differentiates the two.  Minecraft costs a lot, especially if you're a kid in a poor country, or you want to install it on every computer in the classroom, or even an entire school.  But for the money you're getting a fleshed out product.  For some use cases you can't beat that.


((WN))  Will the improvement in the graphics of the game compromise with the advantage of the game running on older hardware?  Is it possible to achieve both without any compromises?


((Perttu Ahola))  Improvement in graphics will compromise the advantage of being able to run on old hardware, or it will result in basically two separate rendering engines.  To take advantage of new hardware you have to switch to newer versions of OpenGL, heavily use shaders and such, and as a result old hardware simply grinds to a halt or simply doesn't support those.


Of course some improvement can be done without compromise, but it's relatively minor if you look at what gamers are expecting these days.  On the other hand for use by kids or education or such, looks don't really matter.  What matters is that it's able to run on the hardware they happen to have.


((WN))  Would you want to create two different engines for those players who have new hardware and want to enjoy the open-source game?


((Perttu Ahola))  Maybe, but I'm not the one to do it.  High-end graphics is quite a specialized field and it's especially specialized when you want to render a voxel world like this, with voxel-based lighting and whatnot.  For more common types of game environments you could use more easy-to-use solutions.


((WN))  What contributors are the most wanted at the moment? What activities are in dire need of more eyeballs and helping hands?


((Perttu Ahola))  Any kind of contribution is always welcome.  I don't think I'm in a position to pick and choose what people spend their time on.  If you contribute something because it's important to you, it's going to be important to some others too.  I also can't pick and choose what skills people have.  If you are a capable programmer and for some crazy reason have lots of free time that you don't know what to do with, you can absolutely trust me and other core developers to give you things to do for the rest of your life.  But that's not how it works, nobody is like that.  You do what you like and what you feel is important.  You will be thanked by the users.


On the off chance that I can get a programmer inspired to do something for us: We've been long thinking of Voxel Area Entities — basically objects that are built from the same blocks that the world is, but that can move within the world based on some kind of moddable logic, like physics.  Every year I'm asked by a different person when I'm going to do it, and every year I've had some other project I'm focusing on.  Most core developers don't feel they have what it takes to even try doing that.


Other massive ideas floating in the air in the Minetest developer community, core developers and contributors alike, is abstracting away and switching the rendering engine to something more modern, probably something made by us to fit the needs of Minetest instead of some generic game graphics engine.


((WN))  For how long do you see yourself continuing to work as the CEO of the project?


((Perttu Ahola))  Until I'm dead, probably.  Not because I really want to, but because it's not something anyone else wants to do.


What would you choose, going on the beach, pub or golf field to take it easy, or staying in your basement looking through issues and pull requests, thinking when you're going to upgrade the forum software, trying to figure out why something was implemented in some way in the code, writing about some idea you have that hasn't still been implemented in seven years?


See, I'm absolutely crazy.  Most people aren't.


It's actually an interesting question: Is there any way I could be replaced?


((WN))  Is there a way to?


((Perttu Ahola))  I do think some parts of Minetest have been made as student projects.  Such extra motivation helps getting things done.  Maybe a tech leadership school could take Minetest CEO as a student project position?  Like, do it for a year and get lots of points.  Just an idea I guess.


Also, I kind of hate the subject.  In that way I'm more of a CTO [Chief Technical Officer] than a CEO.


((WN))  Do you think Minetest can benefit from programmes such as Google Summer of Code?


((Perttu Ahola))  Maybe, but it's difficult to compete with other projects there and the person doing it has to already be a contributor with a task in mind.  Otherwise it takes way too much prepping work to get somebody going in anything larger.  Self motivation is key in getting something done in a project like this.


Nobody will make you do anything or guide you.  You have to want to do it, and ask for help.  We also don't have any centralized official organization in any country, so we can't really collect funds and pay people to do things.


Money, official forms, agreements — No thanks.  Throw it in the trash.  Our agreement is the LGPL license of the code and CC BY-SA of other assets — it's the bare minimum and works.


Enrolling Minetest into GSoC could be the contribution of someone.  I don't think there's anything stopping that.  It could be quite beneficial to the project.


((WN))  How can the community ensure that the Minetest project succeeds for the foreseeable future?


((Perttu Ahola))  Use it, teach other people how to use it, share your in-game and mod creations with other people.  Of course reporting and fixing bugs and contributing engine features helps, but the main reason it exists is because it has users that enjoy playing it.


Whether something is a ""thing"" really only depends on whether it's popular.


((WN))  When did you actually think Minetest was getting significant attention and it was getting popular?'


((Perttu Ahola))  When I started posting about it on the Irrlicht forums and other places on the 'net, it immediately became obvious there was interest for such a thing.  I mean, compared to Minecraft, it has always been tiny.  But it was something completely different to anything else I had published until then in terms of public interest.  It wasn't just one person saying they checked it out.  It easily created a thread with people arguing whether it was even legal to make one like it.


((WN))  The legal aspect is something even I wondered about.  But you haven't received any legal notices, right?


((Perttu Ahola))  Well, it might have not been obvious then that it is legal, but nowadays there are so many Minecraft-like games everywhere people don't even think about it any more.  Nothing at all, ever.


And why would I [get a legal notice?] — it's completely made from scratch and I've never seen any Minecraft source code.  That wouldn't be the reason I'd change the name.  But changing the name isn't really doable.  You could of course publish it in addition under a second name and leave the engine called Minetest.  But what's the point?


Minetest is such a bad name it works as a trademark in itself.  Nobody wants to copy it.  It doesn't sell, but we don't need to sell.  If it was a serious commercial endeavour I would never had named it that in the first place.  [A trademark lawsuit would] only make Minetest grossly more popular, and we could simply change the name.  Really nothing is stopping us, if we need to, but there's not really any need.


((WN))  What are some of your other hobbies?


((Perttu Ahola))  In addition to programming I also do electronics as a hobby.  I'm very interested in electric vehicle [EV] conversions and have done some reverse engineering for re-using parts from crashed EVs.  Some of that has been released as open source.  Well, in addition to having them as hobbies, I also work in programming and electronics.  But anyway — whether money is involved or not, that's what I do.


I've also tried to do some other game development.  That was more of a learning experience than something that would have resulted in an end product.


((WN))  What sport activities do you normally undertake to stay strong and healthy? How has the pandemic affected them?


((Perttu Ahola))  I'm not a very sporty person.  If I feel so, I'll go for a walk or ride to town and back with my bicycle.  I do try to eat quite healthy though.  The pandemic hasn't had much effect on my life overall.  I've just shifted from less remote work to more remote work.


((WN))  What are some of the important things your have learned as an open-source game developer?


((Perttu Ahola))  Well, most game ideas suck, and the programming doesn't really matter.  Game development isn't something I'd recommend for anyone, it's such a saturated field.


((WN))  Saturated field?


((Perttu Ahola))  I mean, too many people are making games already.  It's such a popular hobby.


((WN))  Well those were all the questions I had for you.


((Perttu Ahola))  (That was quite a lot of questions, I think that'd make a small book so far. :-))


((WN))  Anything you would like to add?


((Perttu Ahola))  I don't think so.


((WN))  Thank you so much, being so generous with your time, celeron55.  It was wonderful discussing about Minetest with you!


((Perttu Ahola))  No problem, it's not too often I answer so much things about my longest ever project.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Iran_issues_arrest_warrants_for_36_people,_including_US_President_Trump;_seeks_Interpol%27s_aid",2020-07-02,"Iran issues arrest warrants for 36 people, including US President Trump; seeks Interpol's aid","On Monday, state-owned Iranian news agency Fars reported Iran issued arrest warrants on 36 people believed to have been involved in the assassination of the general Qasem Soleimani in January and demanded from Interpol to publish a red notice for US president Donald Trump.


According to semi-official news agency ISNA, the prosecutor general of Tehran, Ali Alghasi Mehr, said the 36 must face ""murder and terrorism charges"", adding Iran will pursue the prosecution of Trump even after he ends serving as president of the US. Among the 36 arrest warrants, Trump's was the only identity disclosed.


Red notices are declared to ask local authorities across the globe to find and arrest a person wanted by a judicial jurisdiction or an international tribunal with a view to his/her extradition on behalf of the country requesting it. A red notice doesn't force countries to conduct the arrest but may limit the suspect's freedom to travel.


Interpol's constitution prohibits ""any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character,"" an Interpol spokesperson stated. The spokesperson added regarding Iran's request, they ""would not consider requests of this nature""; Interpol didn't disclose at the time whether it received any arrest warrants from Iran.


On a press conference held in Saudi Arabia, US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook said, ""This is a political nature. This has nothing to do with national security, international peace or promoting stability"". He added, ""It is a propaganda stunt that no-one takes seriously.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Zara_Kay_tells_Wikinews_about_her_non-profit_organisation_Faithless_Hijabi,2020-07-06,Zara Kay tells Wikinews about her non-profit organisation Faithless Hijabi,"A number of Muslim-majority countries around the world implement Shari'a — commonly known as Islamic law — and have laws against apostasy and blasphemy.  Numerous times, over the years, people have been sentenced to death penalty for renouncing Islam.  Back in 2018, a Pakistani journalism student Mashal Khan was killed by a mob lynch after he was accused of blasphemy.  At times there have been protests against the restrictions on free speech in Islam.


Other than the restriction of free speech, many Muslim majority countries have declared homosexuality as a capital crime, and observe a strict dress code for women.  Iran has banned a number of female chess players for not wearing a hijāb.  An Iranian woman was sentenced 20 years for removing hijāb while protesting the strict dress code.


Wikinews had gotten in touch with Tanzanian-born ex-Muslim Zara Kay to discuss the struggles an ex-Muslim woman faces, as well as her organisation: Faithless Hijabi.  Faithess Hijabi is an organisation which helps other ex-Muslim women by sharing their stories and experiences.  Its Facebook page has over 7000 likes, and Zara Kay, who identifies herself as an antithiest, had prefiously helped a Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed escape to Canada.


The following is the interview with Zara Kay that took place last year.


So, how are you doing?


((Zara Kay))  I am good, thanks. Um, really busy [...] How are you?


((WN))  I am doing well.


((WN))  Can you tell us something about yourself?


((Zara Kay))  Um yeah.  So I was born in Tanzania.  And then, I left Tanzania when I was 16.  I moved to Malaysia.  And then, I moved to Australia at the age of 19.  I took off my headscarf right before I moved to Australia: so I was about 18, 19.  And yeah, so I come from a Shi'a background.  The specific community is called the Khoja Shi'a Ithna Asheri Jamaat.


((WN))  How old are you?  And when did you decide to start Faithless Hijabi?


((Zara Kay))  So, I am 26 now.  And I started Faithless Hijabi last year [in 2018].  So I was 25 when I started Faithless Hijabi.


So in terms of the goals for our organisation: it started off and it still at its core remains a story-telling platform.  We want to engage our audiences by making them aware of the people living either in the Middle East who come from a Muslim background in the West; girls who have escaped; girls who have emancipated; girls would run away from home; girls have gone through emotional and physical abuse, right?  Before leaving religion, after leaving religion.  Sometimes those are the reasons that had caused them to question religion: the way they were treated.  Being subservient to men.


So the core of the organisation and the goals are to encourage empathy by story-telling.  And our core principles for Faithless Hijabi is always keeping true to our audience by sharing stories that we've received.  And also, it's a global movement, so we have girls coming from everywhere.  It could be from the Maldives, it could be from Canada.  Some of them from Somalia, some of them from East Africa.  Many of them from the Middle East, but also so many from the UK itself.


We also have converts.  And it's open to, basically, all ex-Muslims.  But we've also had curious Muslims as well, who are like, ""I'm questioning [the faith], but I like the identity [as a Muslim], but I don't believe in God"".  It's a very confusing phase for so many.  So sometimes they take longer to even reach that stage.  I've seen girls who have taken a year and a half from when I first first spoke to them until now.


((WN))  Okay, so what motivated you to start this organisation, and who supported you when the organisation was very young?


((Zara Kay))  So initially I started it with a Christian male friend of mine.  We had different goals but in the end it ended up molding into what it is now.  Initially we wanted to create a Sydney-based group for people to question things.  But that wasn't safe for many people.  Not many people would come out as curious Muslims.  So we had to then narrow down our field to talk to people who had already come out.  So I've always been leading it.  I've had a few people help me with the setups of it — registering the non-profit, but I was motivated by my own experiences.  I wanted to know what other girls had gone through because I had gone through the same thing.  While I come from a relatively liberal family, I still felt very lost, but also found: I had found my new identity.  And I was learning how to settle into it.  But I also wanted to know: can women come together and help each other?


Because we still go through a lot of security risks with the girls' stories that we get, a lot of girls are not comfortable talking to other people, so they'll talk to me, or they'll talk to other volunteers: it's always a one-on-one thing.  We couldn't actually create a community yet.  We're working on it now to create a community.  But what had motivated me was finding validation and aligning what my story was to other stories.  Because I had heard of other ex-Muslim women like Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Sara Haider.  And bits of their stories were the way I was thinking but I didn't know how to confront it.  And I could only imagine that there's so many girls like me who are going through the same phase.  And it only made sense to then reach out to women; ask them for their stories; and initially, I would read the entire story on my own and publish it.  So it was a one-woman-run-organisation until March this year [2019].  So from October [2018] to March [2019], I was the only one running it.


((WN))  Was it your full-time job?


((Zara Kay))  No it wasn't my full-time job.  For a part, it was full-time, but most of it, it was done part-time when I had full-time employment.


((WN))  So were you scared or were you anxious when you just started the organisation?  And did you have any prior experience working in any Non-Government Organisation?


((Zara Kay))  No I didn't.  I didn't even know it was going to be this big.  I didn't know it would reach 2000 or 3000 likes. I wasn't expecting it to.  I just wanted a Facebook page that would connect people, that would be an advocacy.  I was really excited about it because I've wanted so many women to come together and share their stories.  And also find a sense of community with sharing stories.


Also I think the one thing that we always achieve after we've received stories is that a lot of people have never shared their stories before.  So they find a lot of comfort.  And it's like journaling for them.  It is their experience.  There is nothing they're making up.  But they haven't actually spoken about it to anyone.  And  that's what we aim to achieve in the long term: giving women that safe haven or a safe space to share their story; having their stories be an advocacy for other ex-Muslim women or ex-Muslim women in general; but also on the other end, inspiring other people to come forward and talk about it.  It all has to do with normalising it.


((WN))  Why did you choose this name Faithless Hijabi?


((Zara Kay))  Because for the longest time hijāb for many, and knowing in Iran it's forced.  But there's so many women who have been doubting hijāb — not religion, just hijāb.  But we came up thinking how do we portray an ex-Muslim woman who is faithless but can't come out?  And hijāb felt like a good cover where a lot of people who are questioning would still wear it because they're not sure yet and hijāb was that identification of Muslim women but what happens when they're faithless: they're not Muslim women but they're still hijābi.  And they can be hijābi and they can be faithless Muslims.  If you take Muslims as a cultural name.


((WN))  Do you put all your time behind Faithless Hijabi or do you work at other places?


((Zara Kay))  I have two other jobs, so on weekdays, I am a programmatic analyst in a media agency.  And on weekends, I work as a bartender.  Only because I'm trying to have more time outside Faithless Hijabi while growing it part-time.  So Faithless Hijabi is very much part-time for me.


((WN))  What is your role at the organisation?


((Zara Kay))  My role in Faithless Hijabi is, well besides founding it, I do the strategy part.  So I am strategic lead.  I'll decide on what campaigns we should put out, what conversation starters do we have, how to reach other women, what tech we should be investing in.  So I do pretty much the top-level operations part of it.  And the tech part of it because I come from a technical background.  And then we have a few volunteers who do the Arabic page of Instagram and the English page of Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.


((WN))  How many people volunteer for the organisation?


((Zara Kay))  At the moment, we're about four people.  We're trying to get more volunteers to come in.  But we're in the process of actually establishing a better non-profit structure.  So looking for more experienced people who can help us drive it forward.  All the girls who work at Faithless Hijabi are actually ex-Muslim women and real faithless hijābis as well. Who wear a hijāb but can't take it off.


((WN))  Do they all work full-time?


((Zara Kay))  They all work. Faithless Hijabi for many is on volunteer basis.  We have no funding.  We haven't decided to apply for funding because we're waiting on a better structure, we're waiting for more growth which is probably happening in the next two three months.  So we just released our Arabic page about less than a month ago, or a month ago and that is still gaining traction slowly.  But we plan to keep growing it.


((WN))  What is the outline of how the organisation functions?


((Zara Kay))  So, with Faithless Hijabi,  we now have a website where women can submit stories.  A large part of our growth was based on my growth as an activist.  And the more ex-Muslim women reached out to me, the more I would tell them to send me a story.  The more I would start opening Faithless Hijabi to all of them to send stories.  But now that we have a website, whenever an ex-Muslim or anybody on my inbox comes along, or somebody highlights an ex-Muslim tweet, I always just post the link.  And they will share their stories.  And it has pointers on what stories we're looking for, what pointers we have, and anything else they would like to add.  We want to keep it to free speech.  We want the girls to feel safe.  So it's always anonymous.  The stories come to us, and then I send it to the publishers that work with us: with Faithless Hijabi.  Girls I have personally vetted, know them personally, and because they're sensitive stories, the publishers will edit out if there're any typos or if the story needs to be in a particular structure of flowing.  And that's what happens in the English page.  And in the Arabic page, we get translators to translate the story.  One of our volunteers is based in the Middle East, behind an identity because nobody can know who she is.  And she translates stories, and she takes care of the Arabic page.  Only because we didn't want somebody who didn't know Arabic to just keep posing stories but [instead] know what they're writing about.  So we want authenticity.  We don't want to automate it completely.  And we want our volunteers to be as engaged to then publish the stories to engage audiences as well.  


((WN))  How does a normal day at work look like for you?


((Zara Kay))  So with Faithless Hijabi, because I spent a couple of hours between my activism and Faithless Hijabi, I will do, depending on what work there is remaining: it could be finishing up the website.  It could be: I personally — girls who come through Faithless Hijabi — I mentor them and coach them.  It could be from coaching them on how to remove their hijāb even if they're Muslims they'll come to me.  And even if they're ex-Muslims also come to me, apparently, despite our difference in beliefs, they find comfort in talking to somebody who's not going to push them to wear a hijāb.  So some of my days can be working with girls who have mental health issues and most of them happen to be Muslims.  Or working with girls on helping them achieve better conversations or being comfortable with removing the hijāb.  And this could be girls from the age of 15 and above.  My rule is mainly to guide them to get their answers, or to help them understand that being an ex-Muslim can come as a big burden to your families.  And despite us wanting to accept it, we also need to accept that there they would not accept it: that we need to learn to create better boundaries between us and our families.  And that has personally worked for me.  On and off, sometimes even I fail to hold up that system of boundaries.  But by-and-large, I just have to coach girls into, well, one being independent in their decisions; two, also, being faithful, when they take those decisions are they safe [unintelligible].  So there's a lot of coaching and mentoring happening.  And then there is, the operations side that is happening as well.  So, right now we're looking for more volunteers to help us.  But at the moment I've been carrying a lot of different things that I need to do.


((WN))  According to you what is the significance of a hijāb?


((Zara Kay))  Well, I don't think hijāb has ever been a choice for any of us really, who were born Muslims, who were told that hijāb is what good Muslim women do.  So, we were coerced to wearing it.  At this point in this day and age, a lot of the girls wear it as a political identity: they want to be recognised as a Muslim.  A lot of them don't even know how hijāb came about based on its history.  They don't know a lot of the stories that are about hijāb.  They don't question why the hijāb is there for women as clothing and not the same for men. They've just learned to accept it.  So, I think at this point the significance of hijāb is mostly as a political identity.


((WN))  Did you first hear a hijāb willingly?


((Zara Kay))  I was eight and I thought I chose to wear it.  But like I said, at a young age I've always seen with some women wear hijāb until I was 16 and moved overseas.  So I think, I would say I was coerced into wearing hijāb.  It wasn't fully a informed choice of mine, or an informed decision.  But I did say I want to wear it.  And my parents did not shy away from it, they accepted my decision because I would have had to wear it when I was nine.  I started when I was eight.


((WN))  When did you decide not to wear a hijāb?


((Zara Kay))  I was about 18 when I decided I would take it off.  But even before then, I started slowly loosening it up or showing my hair on the front.  I used to wear an abaya as well.  So I took off the abaya and I just wear a headscarf.  And I think, when I actually took it off, I was 18 turning 19.


((WN))  That was when you were in Australia, right?


((Zara Kay))  That was when I was in Malaysia, about to go to Australia.


((WN))  What was your childhood like?


((Zara Kay))  My childhood well: I am one of six.  So I have been brought up my oldest brother and then two older sisters and younger sister.  So, my sisters are already set the precedence that they wore hijāb and I had to wear hijāb.  But at the same time, I grew up in a very relatively liberal family.  My family was happy to send me overseas for education.  They did expect me to still be a Muslim.  They did expect me to come back.  I think life just changed and I decided to go to Australia and they supported me.  So they've never been extremist: they've been conservative.  They have just been in their little bubble in Tanzania, like they have travelled a lot, but they have never really experienced life living in the West, or even just progressive values, in general.  However, there were always — despite the passive-aggressiveness — they've always been relatively kind to me.  There's a bit of emotional blackmail now knowing that I'm not a Muslim and a public activist.  But they still talk to me, we're still amicable.  Sometimes, I just have to take a little bit of space.


My childhood was relatively fine.  It was never a reason why I left Islam.  It was always: at the age of 13, I stopped praying and my dad would tell me to keep praying, but he'd never really enforce it: he was just ask and the guilt would drown me.  But, when I moved overseas, I didn't really care much about prayers, about religion.  Even if I wore a hijāb, it was never the forefront, I barely went to mosque.  So, my family was never a reason why I rejected the religion.  The more I studied about it, the more people I met who aren't religious: they helped me question the religion in ways such as: they were such kind people who were gay and I could never get myself to hate gay people.  I could never reject them for their sexuality.  I never really thought that they should be with the woman.  And also, the more I studied religion, when I was trying to understand more about creating peace with gay people, or creating peace with people who don't accept your religion; more I was surprised that it didn't exist.


((WN))  What were the incidents that compelled you to step into helping other women?


((Zara Kay))  I think, going through mental health anxiety myself, and I remember calling my mom once.  And after I was diagnosed, like, you know, five-six months after I was diagnosed with anxiety, I used to get panic attacks every night.  And I remember calling my mom and I asked.  And I told my mom I have anxiety, and she's like ""you need to pray more"".  And I started crying and I said, ""You're not listening to me.  I have done everything.""  And I wasn't even an ex-Muslim.  I just didn't even know.  I tried reading the Qur'an on my phone, it didn't help.  It just made me me feel worse because I knew what the book like I knew a lot about the book: [it] wasn't very peaceful.  And having that experience, I started reading a lot of books outside the Qur'an.  Be it atheism, psychological well-being, self-help.  And once I got to a stage where I could take care of myself, I wanted to help other girls.  I wanted to help other girls who couldn't.  So many girls I helped are Muslims.  They still choose to be Muslims, but anxiety and depression is something they suffer from.  So, because I've been through all of that, I wanted to be a helping hand making girls feel like they were never alone.  And religion had nothing to do with it.


I mean, for me, a lot of my anxiety was tied into religion.  But my relationship with other people didn't have much do with religion.


((WN))  You describe yourself as an anti-theist, right?


((Zara Kay))  Yeah, I do.


((WN))  Could you tell us about the time when you were skeptical of your faith?


((Zara Kay))  It started in phases.  I was about 12  or 11 years old, and I went to Syria.  And because I come from a religious background, in Syria, you go visit all the shrines.  And I saw people praying to the shrines and kissing the shrines: and I'm like I know it comforts people to be to show love to a symbol, but why are they praying to it.  And I could never understand, so I tried creating mental gymnastics in my head, and I'm like: ""Oh no, they still believe in Allah, but they're praying to it [the shrines] because they know that this person was close to Allah.""


And then, they were small things like ""Who created God?""  And this is at a very young age.  And as I grew up, and I started questioning things about Shi'as and Sunnis.  And I started learning more about Sunnis since I wanted to bridge the gap.  And that, I think, from the age of 17 or 18, I only called myself a Muslim.  Some people went like ""Are you a Shi'a or Sunni?"" and I said, ""No, I am a Muslim"".  That was slowly me trying to come out from those labels.  And making my own destiny, I would say.  Or choosing my own path versus  what I was born with.  And then, I critically started questioning it in 2016.  And I was exposed to a lot of Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  And listening to their podcasts, I think a lot of it just made me anxious because I could relate to it but I did not know how to get there.


((WN))  Did that attract any violence or threat?


((Zara Kay))  I mean, just expressing myself as a supporter of gay people and a Muslim I got a lot of abuse online.  I couldn't understand why people would hate them so much: why would people hate anyone so much.  So yeah, like, even just as a curious Muslim, I got a lot of violence but even now I get death threats.  And I think, if you have seen my Twitter, my Instagram, and Facebook with the lot with a lot of threats with anything I do; even if it's not meant to be provocative.  Even if it's just a photo of me, everybody just wants to attack you on everything.  I literally have people from Tanzania, who knew that I suffered from a health issue, and they would always hold it against me every time.  So yeah, I do have people who intentionally would try bullying me.


((WN))  Does the organisation provide help to ex-Muslim females who are abused by the families for questioning faith?


((Zara Kay))  Yes, it does.


((Zara Kay))  No, usually, if you talk to anybody who is religious — because apostasy is
punishable by death [in Islam] — and because these are people who've been brought up with that ideology, the likelihood is that any questions they ask the answer would be ""Don't question God"", or ""You're interpreting it wrong"", or ""Maybe you should ask somebody who's a scholar"".  And then, a lot of people, when they go to scholars and even when I had recently come out [as an apostate], I was scared of going to scholars because I was so embarrassed of not being smart enough to know this answer.  But there were logical fallacies and a lot of the mental gymnastics are being played to keep you in the religion.  So, no your faith would not help you to in the questioning phase.


((WN))  Soes the organisation help Muslim men who are skeptical of their faith?


((Zara Kay))  The organisation as such is built for women and their story.  But because I come as part of the organisation, they're very much intertwined.  Which is great, because there are: well I have my activism as being an anti-theist; my organisation serves purposes
to engage women in critical thinking, and being advocacy for ex-Muslim women.  There is a bit of an overlap, but personally yes, I do help ex-Muslim men or Muslim men who are thinking about it.  A lot of times it ends up in abuse, where I get harassed, I get abused.  I've had so many men who have tried harassing me.  And then would end up insulting me only because I had tried questioning them.  Or I would help them through it and sometimes it would be fake and they would just waste my time.  And now, I don't: because I were initially when I came out I was so willing to help other men, but it would blow up in my face.  I find women to be even if they're harsh when they begin with, they slowly warm up to the idea thinking, ""Hey, you're actually not that bad.  We may have different faiths, and you offend me but you're making some sense"".  And I would just ask them simple questions.  With men, they find it easy to use sexual harassment, instead of admit to me challenging their critical thinking.  But there are a few men that I have helped on-and-off.  A lot of them talk to all other activists, so I think in bits and pieces.  As ex-Muslim activists, we always help other people going through a similar phase.


((WN))  Do women who live in those countries where Shari'a is implemented, do they reach out for help?


((Zara Kay))  Yeah!  Absolutely!  Yeah yeah, so, we have a lot of Saudi women.  I actually helped a Saudi girl escape.  It was a financial help to moral support.  But she escaped, and she's safe in the Western country and that was pride and joy for me.  And yeah, we have a lot of women from, like, parts of Indonesia, parts of Malaysia, a lot of Middle Eastern women as well who have reached out for help.  And even though they know nothing can be done off it, they've they just want to talk sometime.  And if you talk about it, and I think in very little ways me and my volunteers will try helping them.  Sometimes they're forced marriages even in Canada.  And that's not even about Shari'a law -- we'll try providing as much support as we can we.  We don't have any financial help, so usually all the financial help comes in from crowdfunding.


((WN))  Who supports Faithless Hijabi financially?


((Zara Kay))  I support it.  I worked two jobs to support anything that I can.  I stopped my career for since March last year [2018], I took a sabbatical.  So I was traveling.  I was sick for a bit.  And then once I was recovering, I took some time out for Faithless Hijabi.  I had a lot of savings and I supported it in terms of registering it.  A lot of my time spent online.  Even in the tech and everything, I've supported it fully with my savings.  And that's why it means a lot to me and I've kept it really close and we haven't really gone into government funding.  Because, sometimes it's hard to justify where the money can go.  Especially, if we're trying to crowd-fund an air ticket, which can potentially be illegal.  But I think moving forward, we want to come up with programs that would help ex-Muslim women in those situations, such as in financial situations which has mostly to do with education, but help them get up to speed so they can be financially independent.  That's one of the things about leaving your religion: more often you're ostracised from your family and cut out from any finances.  So, we're hoping to apply for government grants, use part of their grants, to award ex-Muslim women and help them get settled in their new career path.  It could be maybe paying part of their tuition, or maybe helping them find a temporary accommodation.  We're still discussing that.  So nothing is in stone.


((WN))  What are the short-term and the long-term goals of the organisation?


((Zara Kay))  So the short-term goals for now is translating our content.  And creating specific blog post so we should be releasing our blog post next month-sish.  So we're still getting stories in.  So our short-term goals are a lot about stories, written articles and reaching out to other ex-Muslims.


Long-term goals: the way I see Faithless Hijabi is working alongside with other ex-Muslim organisations.  We would like to specialise in helping women with their rights: with helping them encouraging their rights.  So I think, in the long term, we're hoping that it will grow enough to be recognised globally.  And hopefully, create an online community which we have not yet stepped into.  Only because we have a lot of activity to do before we can create that.  So I think, long-term goals would be actually creating a community of ex-Muslim women.


((WN))  Are there any sister organisations of Faithless Hijabi outside the UK?


((Zara Kay))  So Faithless Hijabi is actually registered in Australia as a charity.  Only because I'm Australian and I'm temporarily in the UK.  But Faithless Hijabi is a global movement.  So we're mostly based online regardless of being set up in Australia.  We have one person working from the Middle East.  You have two of us working in the UK.  One or two people working in Australia.  So, that's the way we've been put up.  But in terms of sister organisations, I would think parts of what we do resemble with a lot of organisations which are in the UK already based a lot of other existing organisations like EXMNA [Ex-Muslims of North America],  CEMB [Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain].  I help run the Australian ex-Muslim group as much as I can from being in distance.  So the partner organisations are pretty much the ex-Muslim organisations.  But also others that could coincide with the Free From Hijab movement.  I think a lot of what we do can partly resemble with many other organisations.  We've tried to narrow down what we'd like to specialise in.


((WN))  What are the struggles of a Muslim woman in present day and age?


((Zara Kay))  I think with being Muslim there there exists anti-Muslim bigotry, especially, for hijabis.  And well, I don't personally endorse the hijāb, I would never let anybody else be a subject for anti-Muslim bigotry.  So I think, at present, Muslim women: one they either suffer with identity crisis especially in the West, where they've been told to wear a hijāb.  They're not sure of wearing the hijāb but at the same time, they're there is so much anti-Muslim bigotry in the West that it's one of those things that you hold so dear to yourself.  Because everybody else doesn't want you to, if that makes sense.  Because there's so many Muslim women being attacked.  Even I would stand up, especially, for those women.  And sometimes a lot of girls will do it  by wearing the hijāb.  So I think, with Muslim women, there is struggle to our identity issues.  Also, being the subject of anti-Muslim bigotry is a big one.  But, a lot of it has to come down: some girls that I helped are actually victims of double standards in their family.  So the boys would get different rights, the girls would get different rights.  I never had to face that.  But a lot of other girls actually have that as a main concern.  


((WN))  What are the struggles of an ex-Muslim woman in present day and age?


((Zara Kay))  A lot, actually.  One, there's ostracism at it place.  So while you're in your new identity, you're still really scared to be out there.  Weather out there means leaving home, or weather out there means being online in public.  Ex-Muslims are the minority of the minority.  We have been ostracised, we have been abused.  We constantly get threats.  We're constantly in the face of violence, or in the face of being undermined.  Our free-speech is revoked.  And there's so many other struggles that we face as ex-Muslims as a whole.  But with women, there is a lot of sexual harassment that comes into play.  The moment you don't wear a hijāb: even if you're a Muslim woman that doesn't wears a hijāb, a Muslim woman will still be respected more than an ex-Muslim woman.  They could be wearing the same clothes, but because you left the faith, you're now in the light of being called a society-slut.  Like, the modesty culture has dependent on women forever, right?  So even if they're women who don't wear a hijāb, those women will attack ex-Muslim women for not wearing the same thing.  But their response is ""at least I'm still a Muslim"".  So I think, you know, harassment is a big thing.  And also being accepted in the society, or just even being accepted by the society is a big thing.  And you lose out your friends and you know, there's a lot of  mental health issues that comes about it, especially because, if you don't have any support while you're finding yourself, you tend to lose yourself even more.  Because there's so much negativity associated with that.  But I've only seen and heard from so many brave ex-Muslims who have been through hell and back.  And despite being alone they've stood up, they've stood out and fallen, and they've stood up and risen.  That's amazing to watch how strong all of these women are.


((WN))  Previously have worked with Rahaf Mohammed, right?


I did work with Rahaf.  So my role with Rahaf: it wasn't like an aligned role.  I was in the plane from London to Sydney and somebody flagged, ""Hey there's a girl who's in Thailand and she's an ex-Muslim girl"".  And that was Rahaf had just come out [as an apostate].  And my role there was to make sure she was okay.  And when she asked for help, I didn't know who to go to, but I looked at other people helping and I collaborated with them.  And my role there was to make sure that as an ex-Muslim she's being heard, and that she's being safe.  And if that involves contacting the UNHCR or contacting the government here, or writing letters, or working with people who are already helping here.  That's what my role encompassed.  Like putting pieces together.  I feel like her story was taken away by the media for being a Saudi women who had run away from male guardianship laws versus being an apostate and a Saudi women.  So apostasy has just been erased from all of it.  And her running away, and you know, when other ex-Muslim spoke about it, it shed a bit of light on the ex-Muslim as a society, I guess, or ex-Muslim as a practice.  Like a practice of disbelief.


((WN))  What do you think are the hurdles around the globe about discussing the questions related to Islam?


((Zara Kay))  I think there is a lot of political correctness.  Even when people share their experiences, their experiences are mostly tarnished by left — the regressive left — who name it as ""oh it's part of your culture"".  But it shouldn't be.  A bad idea whether it's in a culture or religion should not be endorsed at all.


((WN))  So do you find more resistance from Muslims, or Western non-Muslims when you criticise Islam?


((Zara Kay))  I feel like ex-Muslims have been cornered by the right-wing, because they will take advantage of ex-Muslims to further their anti-Muslim bigotry.  And the left-wing would criticise ex-Muslims for speaking up about Islam or their experiences.  And the Muslim right, who are like the Muslim right wing who is more of the Salafi — very extremist practice — who disregard you for ever being a Muslim.  Because if you were every Muslim you wouldn't have left [Islam].  And the left[-wing], who talk about them not being represented as real Muslims, because they are not as extreme as the right wing.  So there's — in the Muslim world — there's always this question on who is the right Muslim.  And that's why ex-Muslims, when they come out, and they decide to criticise the [Islamic] scripture: each side will attack them saying, ""Oh, but we're not homophopic, my sister is gay"", ""So I reject this verse"".  But then the [Muslim] right-wing will go like ""No you cannot be a homosexual.  That's it.  You just can't criticise that part of Islam.  Because God has made you to love women if you're a man"".  So I think, the challenge is the non-Muslim left-and-right wing, and the Muslim left-and-right wing.  And ex-Muslims are at the centre of all of it.  And they're abused even more by all of the sides.  And they're criticised that much.


((WN))  How do you cope with this?


((Zara Kay))  I have pretty much: with the negativity that comes about, I'm pretty much distanced myself.  So, in terms of the way I use social media, I will put up a post, put up a meme, turn off notifications, and then let it go.  sometimes, I do tend to engage, but it's also reminding myself that I'm only going a rabbit hole.  And that there's no real outcome to all of that.  And that I should I should speak to people where I can make changes.  And let go of those for just beyond changes.


Just recently [last June], I posted up the ""Allah is gay"" photo, and I had a lot of backlash and a lot of celebrities — some celebrities complained about it.  But at the same time, I had women who came up to me and she's like, ""Look, if you have any questions about Islam, I'm happy to answer, but I don't like your post"".  And I'm like, ""I am ex-Muslim.  I studied Islam for a long time.  What makes you think that I have questions?  I don't.  I've never asked a question like that since I've come out.  I'm quite happy with my decision.""  And another girl came out to me, started swearing at me, and then I was like, ""Look, the only person who's been disrespectful in this discourse is you.  All I've done is stated my views.  I'm not swearing at you.""  And she, in response, said ""Your dad is gay"".  And I'm like, ""That's okay.  I still love him.  It doesn't matter.""  Like you know, gay people to me are not a threat or a disgust: I don't really care.  And then she's like, ""You seem like a nice person.  Stop offending people.""  And I am like, ""Think about it.  Why are you offended?""  Right?  Every time I ask this question, people are like, ""But he's my god.""  And I'm like, ""Yes, and if you know your scripture, then you should know, that there's so many things about your scripture that even you would disagree with.""  And they're like, ""Yeah, but..."".  You can see there you can see their wheels turning.  So I have tried sometimes — mostly with women — talking to my abusers.  It's like: confronting my abusers and why they hate me.  And that engagement gives me more satisfaction than engaging in somebody in a rabbit hole.


((WN))  Does the internalised-misogyny in Islam pose a significant threat to others?


((Zara Kay))  Apart from what's already out there, it's just a matter of the ones who practice it.  So there are a percentage — a very small percentage — of people who are fundamentalist; and then there are conservative; and then there are liberals.  The ones that we fear the most are not conservatives, they're extremists who would literally take the Word of God, and act upon it.  And there are definitely some parts of Islam, there are a lot of liberals would also disagree with: homophobia being one of them.  Unequal rights for women being another.  And also just, like, the killing of non-believers, polytheists or something that has happened in history, that has been substantiated by ""Oh, it was defence"".  But ISIS seems to take that word literally.  They would also kill Muslims, who are liberal.  So it looks like Islam in itself has been destructive to itself.  And their practices have been destructive to the world, as compared to a secular world.


((WN))  You recently attended the London pride where you posed with the sign ""Allah is Gay"".  Did you carry that sign?  Or did you just pose?


((Zara Kay))  I only posed with it.  So I didn't go for the march, I couldn't make it to the march.  I was not feeling well.  But I only posed with it.  I did however see them passed by, and there were a lot of people who were cheering for those who were in it.  I felt really proud to have known those people, because it's great.  And I didn't think my photo would go viral, I really did not expect so much negativity to come about it.  I'm hoping that in a few days it will shut down, but it looks like there is so much going.  So I have just turned off the notification.  But, I think, for the most part, there weren't any Muslims out there that I could see.  Nobody in a headscarf that I could see.  So, most of the people out there were just like, happy.  They were just they like they don't really care; they just wanted more acceptance.  People were just there to be happy.  But, I think, it was one of those very few days where I didn't see a lot of Muslims in the city.


((WN))  What would you say about that sign: being being an anti-theist, and then saying ""Allah is Gay""?


((Zara Kay))  As  contradictory as it sounds, if you think about it, in your narrative, if somebody who's a theist, who accepts Allah as being a God, their God, or one of the gods, right?  Him being gay would only be offensive if you're homophobic, right?  Had I said ""Allah is not gay"", nobody would have that descent.  I say if ""Allah is straight"", nobody would really care, would they?  So, I think this highlights the negativity that is being associated with being gay.  As a person who doesn't believe, and when I read that, I could have said Peter Pan is gay.  And because he doesn't exist, it doesn't matter to me.  It could be a figment of my imagination.


So the idea for that was one to normalise that being gay is okay.  I don't understand: no, I think I understand, why people have taken it in a very crude way.  But it's also because they cannot comprehend that being gay is okay.  Well, I know it has provoked a lot of people, the way people have responded to it: now I have a few Muslim friends who are like, ""I don't really care if you say Allah is gay.  He could be.  He could be not.  I don't know"", right?  So yeah, I have had Muslim friends respond to it and I was like, ""Very few people think like that"".  See, like now I know that you're a peaceful person, right?  And, the way the majority of the people have responded have just highlighted that despite ""Jesus being queer"" as a poster, ""Allah being gay"" had more of an outrage: it had a lot of an outrage.  It just highlights the domination that Islam has over other religion, and why, if we had to rank as one of the most dangerous ideology, Islam would take the rank.  And it has a lot to do with its political identity in this landscape.  You know, taking dominance over other religion.  And while there is an increased rate of birth rate, there is also an increased rate of extremism and terrorist activities that come about Islamic terrorism.


((WN))  What are the recurring insults you have received because of your volunteer work and your stance against Islam?


((Zara Kay))   A lot of them have to do with sexual harassment from: the way I look, to my hair, my [sexual-]orientation.  So I'm straight, but because I'm a supporter of LGBT; because I'm an ally of the LGBT community; I have been called a lot of different names.  A lot of it has to do with the way I look, which doesn't really affect me.  Because I like the way I look.  But most of it has to do with calling me a bitch, calling me a slut, like all the negative connotations you can you associate a woman with.  So yeah, it's a lot of sexual harassment: like 90% of it is sexual harassment.


((WN))  What would you suggest [for] other fellow ex-Muslims to cope with it?


((Zara Kay))  I think it is important to have a healthy balance with social media to help a healthy relationship.  Understand when your body is psychologically rejecting the negativity.  And once it does that or once you see yourself getting into a Twitter fight, or Instagram fight, you shut it.  So having a healthy relationship with social media.  Also being less affected by what people think of you.  If you truly think you're doing the right thing, take feedback only from those people who you would seek advice from.


And that doesn't mean everybody in the world.  That could possibly mean just your close friend.  So don't let what other people think of you bring you down.  Yeah, I think that's how I would
see it.


((WN))  How does the PC culture affect important discussions about Islam?


((Zara Kay))  I think a lot of people: lot of the left-half try to regress our voices because it is offensive to ones culture or religion.  But they don't take it by the subject-matter, they have found it difficult to be objective in our arguments.  And that has affected so many from raising their voices.  But that has also brought many together to raise their voices.  And because the left is being really regressive, a lot of the attention that ex-Muslims get is from the right-wing instead of those who can be centre and objective about things.  I feel like a lot of ex-Muslims have been taken advantage of by the right-wing.  That is one of the negativity that comes out of it because we're then being used to fuel anti-Muslim bigotry as an example.


But it's also because, I think, the left not giving us a platform to talk about it and always continuing to shut us down.  It's only highlighting the bigotry that they hold.  It is an encouragement of bad ideas, intersectional feminism is probably the worst thing that has happened to us as as ex-Muslim or ex-Muslim women, where we're being held by a different standards for feminism.  But we don't get the same rights for feminism.  And situations like Iran and Saudi Arabia are examples of it.  When the Western lefties did not fight for women in Saudi Arabia, they're still always under the precaution of, ""oh but it's their culture.  They are allowed to do it.""  However, if the same world's law is applied to their country they would be totally against it.  It feels like they've been projecting a lot of bigotry which impacts us as ex-Muslims to be critical of, because we're labeled bigots or well labeled as Islamophobes, or Zionists or a Zionist supporter.  So we've been given this title that we don't even hold to put us down.  And sometimes can put a lot of people in a position to not talk anymore.


((WN))  Can you shed light on Islamophobia and Muslimphobia?


((Zara Kay))  So I think Islamophobia is a made-up term.  And it is a term that stops conversation or dialogue about Islam, in general.  Any of those that doesn't shed Islam in a good light, it stops any criticism of an ideology.  Because it gives it a special privilege to not be criticised.  Which is really unfair.  And, there is no other religion that has a phobia attached to it.  So it makes you think, ""Why Islam is the only one which has it"".  I don't like the definition of Islamophobia, which is prejudiced against Muslim and Islam.  People have every right to disagree with an idea.  People have every right to criticise an idea.  But you can't treat human beings with any less dignity.  And that's where I feel like the word needs to be replaced with anti-Muslim bigotry.  I have a Muslim family myself.  So I would only talk about things that I genuinely know that if this was told to my Muslim family they wouldn't be happy: they would feel insulted, alright?  If they're legit concerns about them being ill-treated, like, I've read a lot of far-rights talk about: ""we don't need any Muslims here, Muslims should just go back to where they came from"".  And that's a no.  But if they say we don't need Shari'a law, I would agree with that.  We don't need Islamic law to run our country.  I would agree with that.  Nobody needs it.  A lot of Muslims would also disagree with it.


((WN))  How does anti-Muslim bigotry affect non-Muslims, or ex-Muslims, better say?


((Zara Kay))  I think, to me personally, anti-Muslim bigotry: well, bigotry or extremism of any form is unhealthy.  It is a violation of people's civil rights.  It is treating a human being less than what you would treat others.  The way it affects us is because the more we encourage it, we're encouraging a world of violence.  The more we're encouraging those views.  And I am personally affected because I still have Muslim friends and family.  And I don't hold any prejudice against people who practice a faith in their homes.


I have no problem them practicing it in their homes, provided it doesn't affect the world outside, or the public sphere.  But anti-Muslim bigotry, I think, to me, I'm always reminded of ""what if my family were in that situation?  ""What if they were told go back to where you came from?""  I think every person who values people's rights should be fighting against anti-Muslim bigotry.  And that doesn't mean that you have to allow the ideas that are bad for humankind to glow.  It's important to segregate them and it is definitely hard to do it when you don't want those ideas that you're criticising impacts the people that follow it.  Because they have been — for the most part — many of them have not read their books, many of them don't know why they're in the religion except where they were born in it.  I would like to think that people are better than ideas like that.  But a lot of them have never been given the opportunity to question it, to either leave or to become better.  People despite following the spiritual path of Islam.  I feel like the political part of Islam always takes dominance over a little fundamentalist and conservative Muslims.


((WN))  What do you think of the burka bans that countries like France are pushing forward, citing the secular beliefs?


((Zara Kay))   I'm not a particular fan of bans that aims to police a woman's body, like, in terms of the burka ban.  There are two sides to look at it.  And this is a more centrist position.  One: we're doing the same thing [as mandating burka], which is policing a woman's body by not having them wear it.  And two, in the name of security, yes the ban is very applicable.  But it's really hard to have a position that can be both right to me and still not project the contradiction that I always have.  While I am optimistic about it, that I feel like I can help women come out of wearing the hijāb, it's still a future that I don't see happening.  So with Burka ban, I guess I am mostly in for it and.  And I accept that there does project a security risk when you cover your face.  So no face covering should be allowed of any form.  And it shouldn't be targeted to just the burka.  Because it does project again an anti-Muslim bigotry.  But any masks, or anything that in the public should be banned for security.


At the same time, if when you think about it, there's so many girls that I have spoken to had worn the burka unwillingly, at the age of 10 or 11.  They didn't choose to wear it.  That kid is in grade five or six.  They don't know what's happening.  So in a way, that it's quite good that a country like Sweden are voting to create a bill that kids under, I think, under 18 or 16 should not be wearing the burka.


((WN))  Last Friday, the Tunisian Prime Minister signed a decree banning niqāb.  Are you aware of that?


((Zara Kay))  I don't know much about Tunisia, to be honest.  I only know that there was a gay, I think, Member of Parliament voting, to become the president.  But I don't know much about the burka ban.


((WN))  Well as it happened, on June 27 [2019], there are two suicide bombings in the capital [city of Tunis], and eyewitnesses said that the suicide bomber was wearing a niqab, and hence, they went for a niqab-ban in public institutions.


((Zara Kay))  Well, this is again an example of they actually have data and people that are actually doing acts in, you know, in like the burka ban.  So, I think, it's a good thing because right now, they actually have those data to support the burka ban.  But yeah, interesting.  I didn't know about it.  I'm just reading it up now.


((WN))  Do you find security reason as a valid reason to impose such bans?


((Zara Kay))  Yeah, absolutely.  Bad ideas are bad ideas.  It's just like FGM [Female Genital Mutilation].  I'm not comparing the burka to FGM in a way, but like, just in light of what bad ideas are, FGM is bad.  Although some people do find it good, and religious, and halāl, and everything: that is still a bad idea and we should take it as such.  If the burka has a negative consequence in the country where it is likely to get terrorist attack by women wearing burka, and now they've also had security concerns for it, I think that's a valid reason for it.


((WN))  How can the situation for an ex-Muslim be improved around the globe?


((Zara Kay))  I think having ex-Muslims speak more, defend our rights to speak: because a lot of time we are always in the face of criticism.  Defending their rights to speak is one good thing.  Having the left explore ""how we can further help to create a better world"": I feel like in the end we want a better world.  If that means to criticise bad ideas, then we need to work together to criticise that ideas regardless of whose religious feelings it affects.  I think it's important to put tangible outcomes in the face of those bad ideas:  What happens if we don't talk about this idea.  What happens if we continue to have extremist groups in our country.  Or how can we improve the outlook of the people who are, you know, who are subjected to FGM, or were subjected to forced hijāb.  Forced hijāb is again policing a woman's body people who don't want to wear it: some people who want to wear it.  I think it should be a choice.  Even though like essentially, I don't think it was ever a choice but the only way we can counter this, is there educating women to get their rights.  I think ex-Muslims movement can drastically improve when we have more awareness, more exposure to different platforms.  I think even just normalising that it's okay to leave, it's okay to come out, and providing, you know, having laws that criminalise apostasy: countering those laws of those countries is already a great help for many ex-Muslims.  Because the ex-Muslim movement is on the rise, mostly because it is criminalised.  You face a lot of abuse, ostracism: it's never been easy for any of us to be.  I don't know one ex-Muslim who has found it easy to leave.  There always comes a little: either like s mental trauma, with just to you accepting that, ""Hey you were born as a Muslim.  You used to believe that homosexuality is bad.  And that you hated gay people.""  It's really hard to come to another place where you're like, ""You know what, this is what the new world is like.""  I am constantly learning.  I'm constantly unpacking things.


((WN))  Is reforming a religion going to do any good?


((Zara Kay))  I don't think Islam can ever be reformed.  One reason being the politics involved in Islam, and the fact the book — the Qur'an — is a literal word of God, and the Sunnah is a practices of Muhammad, that are valid in this: in the time he was alive, and every time.  I don't think it can ever be reformed.  I think people reform, people progress, people reject ideas.  I don't think there will be a Qur'an 2.0.  So, I don't see it as point of reforming at all.  However, I am going to support those liberal Muslims, and reformers into fighting to create a better world.  But I personally don't see it reforming.


Do I think there's the need to reform?  If there was a possibility, yes, it would be great [...] Even with Christianity, a lot of it has not reformed.  Homosexuality, as we know it, is still looked down upon; misogyny still exists.  I feel like a lot of the Abrahamic religion[s] have: despite evolving, despite having Islam present, which takes up the lead indignation; a lot of them are still not equal to women's rights.  You know, any good Christian like any practicing conservative Christian household would have different standards for their girls and the boys.  And I mentioned homosexuality is a big thing only because it was the Pride that came out.  But there's a lot of homophobia going on in Twitter since London Pride.  It's not only coming from the Muslims.  It's coming from Christians as well.  A lot of it.  So, thing is, a lot of people will criticise Christianity for it, but they won't say anything about Islam for it.  Because, you know, how could you talk about the religion of Islam?  It is always shunned down.  Every voice, like we discussed earlier, has always been regressed.


((WN))  What are some of the books they would suggest others read?


((Zara Kay))  The first book that I read was The Atheist Muslim by Ali Rizvi who is a friend of mine.  I really like that book.  There's so much as a Shi'a, and him being a Shi'a, I could relate to.  And The Moral Landscape is pretty good.  I only read it half way, but I really like Sam Harris.  I like the way constructs an argument.  And I like the way he talks about it.  And, I have a list: Maajid Nawaz is a good person to follow for a more reformist point of view.  I find his ideas to be very balanced.  Despite being a Muslim himself, I find him to be more welcoming to ex-Muslims.  Richard Dawkins can be somebody who is:  not for curious Muslims, but for those who've already come out.  It's a very good book to kind of tell them how God is an illusion.


And, yeah, and then the other books I read had a lot to do with evolution: Homo Deus [by Yuval Noah Hariri], understanding the world from a different lens.  I read Guns, Germs, and Steel, but I guess, I would suggest The Atheist Muslim, Why There is No God by Armin Navabi and Sam Harris' The Moral Landscape and Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion.


((WN))  Just to be on the same page, I think maybe you misheard the question.  It was almost a similar one.  What are some of the books you would suggest others to read.


((Zara Kay))  Who are the others we are talking about?


((WN))  Like any other person who is skeptical of their faith.  Or in general.


((Zara Kay))  Yeah, [The] Atheist Muslim by Ali Rizvi is good for Muslims.  He talks about his thought process.  Why There is No God by Armin Navabi.  [The] Moral Landscape by Sam Harris.  I am currently reading Enlighten Now by Steven Pinker.  And [The] God Delusion.


((WN))  Is there anything else you would like to add?


((Zara Kay))  Not really.


Well, thank you so much!  All right, it was nice talking to you.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Astronomer_Anthony_Boccaletti_discusses_observation_of_birth_of_potential_exoplanet_with_Wikinews,2020-07-07,Astronomer Anthony Boccaletti discusses observation of birth of potential exoplanet with Wikinews,"In March, a study conducted by astronomer Anthony Boccaletti and other researchers reported potential signs of formation of an exoplanet around the star AB Aurigae.  Exoplanets are those planets which are outside the Solar System.


The host star AB Aurigae is a young star, roughly five million years old, Boccaletti told Wikinews.  In contrast, the Sun is approximately 4.6 billion years old.  Located in the Auriga constellation, AB Aurigae is about 520 light years away from the Earth.  The astronomers observed the protoplanetary disk around the star.


The astronomers used the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescopes in Chile to study this system.  Boccaletti told Wikinews the twists they saw in the protoplanetary disk of gas and dust could be the formation of either a humongous planet, bigger than Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System; or it could less likely be a star, or a brown dwarf.


The disturbance in the twist is located around 30 astronomical units — one astronomical unit is the distance between the Sun and the Earth — from the host star.  That is almost the distance from the Sun to Neptune.  However, the host star AB Aurigae is more massive than the Sun: about 2.4 times the mass of the Sun.  AB Aurigae is classified as a Herbig Ae star, which are known for their brightness.


Boccaletti and his team started observing the system in 2019.  Boccaletti said the researchers would like to follow up the study to confirm the observed twists are indeed the birth of an exoplanet.  ""[I]f we confirm that it's a planet in formation then it becomes very important to follow up"", he said.


There exists multiple theories of exoplanet formation, however, the formation of an exoplanet has never been observed till date.  Discovered in 2016, K2-33b is one of the youngest exoplanets known so far, and it is about 9.3 million years old.


Boccaletti, who works at the Observatoire de Paris, discussed his findings with Wikinews last month.


Thank you for agreeing to discuss your findings on formation of exoplanets.  I would like to discuss the study, and the inferences; as well as what lies ahead to be studied.


((WN))  What prompted your interest in astronomy?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Why I am interested in astronomy?


((WN))  Yeah.


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Uhh... [laughs] because it's fun.  [laughs]  Because it's — it's about objects that are very far from us, and which we never observed before.  So it's always very challenging to understand astrophysical objects which are very distant from us; and very different from what we see in the Solar System, for instance.


((WN))  How did you get involved with this study?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  I was involved because I also took part in the building of the instrument.  So the instrument that we used at the Very Large Telescope; instrument is a SPHERE [Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research].  And so we started the design of the instruments back in 2005, I would say.  So I was involve[d] already at this step.  And then when the instrument was implemented on the sky, on the telescope, I was also involved in the survey, that was accomplished with this telescope.  And, in addition to the survey — in addition to all the observations that the consortium of people who built the instrument was running — I also had my own programs with other colleagues.  And this result is part of these other programs.


((WN))  Was this instrument built specifically for this research?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  It was built for imaging exoplanets and also planetary systems.


((WN))  What drew your attention to AB Aurigae in the Auriga constellation in the first place?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well it's because it was already observed before, of course, so we knew that there was a protoplanetary disc around the star.  And the most recent images were obtained with Alma: the Atacama Large Millimeter Array.  It's an interferometer working in Radio astronomy.  And from this telescope, we already had a suspicion that there might be a planet in formation in this disc.  And this is why we decided to use SPHERE to observe this system.


((WN))  Could you explain this study and its findings?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Yes so: so AB Aurigae is a star which is more massive than the Sun, but also very very young.  The Sun is like 4.5 billion years old; while AB Aurigae is probably only like 5 million years old.  So very young.  And around young stars, we expect planets could be very bright because we are observing in the infrared.  And so we knew that there was a protoplanetary disc around AB Aurigae.  That means a system with a lot of gas, and a lot of dust.  And so when we see this, you can find out that this gas and this dust will evolve into planets.  So this is what we focused on.  We decided to observe with SPHERE in order to observe the very details in the protoplanetary system of AB Aurigae and try to identify if there was [a] planet in the system.  And so what we find is that we have a lot of structures.  And we call these spirals because they have spiral shapes and these spirals are in fact gas, which are taking this shape.  And usually, when we see a spiral, we can infer that there is an object which is perturbating the gas.  The gravitation impact of an object in the gas produces a spiral.  So when you see a spiral in a disk, you try to find which object has triggered the spiral.  Because you know that it's produced by an instability.  So this instability could be anything, but it could be also [a] planet: [a] planet in formation.  So we try to identify if some of these pattern[s], structures in the disk could be related to the presence of a planet.  And so, when we get the images from SPHERE, we find that one of the spiral[s] was twisted.  And it's not a perfect spiral, you have a kind of structure at the tip of one of the spirals, which looks like a twist.  Like if the spiral was twisted.  And this is exactly what we expect from modelisation, from theory of planet formation.  When you ask people doing modelling, what looks like a system in which a planet is forming, and if you have gas in this system, what the image looks like, and they will give you an image which resembles a lot what we observe in AB Aurigae.  So we did not observe a planet, okay? We never detect[ed] a planet.  We detect[ed] a structure which could be the impact of a planet on to the gas.  On to this spiral.  So this is indirect: indirect
detection.


The other problem is that we don't know which mass is creating this structure, this spiral.  So we see the spiral, we see the structure, we have theories indicating that it could be [a] planet.  But we are not able to measure the mass of the object.  So, we concluded that it could be a planet, but it could be also something more massive than a planet.  Like maybe a brown dwarf for instance, an object a little bit more massive than a planet.  So it's still a study that is ongoing.  We are continuing the observations in order to determine if this is actually a planet in formation, or if it is another type of object.


((WN))  What was the timeline of the study?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Oh, the timeline was typically we started by asking telescope-time.  So, requesting telescope-time like a year
ago; last year, basically.  The request for observing time was accepted.  And then, the observation were executed in December 2019.  Last year.


((WN))  Were you initially looking for signs of formation of an exoplanet specifically?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Yes, definitely.  This is exactly why we are observing very young star.  Because we know that the planets are forming when a star is very young; so when it's like one million or five million years old.  And it took about probably a million year for a planet to form.  So it is important to look at very young planet, if you want to understand how the planet forms, you need to look at very young systems.


((WN))  How many countries were involved in the study?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Countries! Oh, so we have some people from France, people from US, people from Taiwan, and people from Belgium.  So we have four countries.


((WN))  And how many people were involved in this study?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Let me check exactly the number of people if I can.  I think we were like ten people?  I can check directly.  There are one, two, three [counts].  We are eleven people.


((WN))  And what are their roles?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Oh, the roles of the other people? Okay, so the other people contributed to the interpretation of the data, mostly.  So once we have done the observation, we need to understand what we are observing.  So we need to compare the observation with models for instance.  So, a lot of people contributed to this comparison.  Some people contributed to making a link with the previous data we have with ALMA.  And that's basically the role of the other people.  And some of them also contributed to the writing of the paper.


((WN))  From which observatory were the observations made?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  They were made from the Very Large Telescope in Chile.


((WN))  Which activity took the most time and attention?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  That's a good point.  [laughs]  I think it's definitely the last: the last phase, of writing the paper.


((WN))  And what was the most difficult part of this investigation?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well the most difficult was to be convinced that we are actually looking at something which is very new, so we need to convince ourselves that it's valuable for scientific publication.  It's not specifically hard, but it requires to be convinced, so to make sure that you have done the analysis correctly.  You don't make any mistake, et cetera.


((WN))  What was your first reaction when you concluded it is likely to be the formation of an exoplanet?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  I think it was very exciting, even though we don't have an image of an exoplanet directly.  Having even a suspicion that it could be a planet-forming, since it is very new; it was very exciting.


((WN))  What was the most fascinating aspect of this study?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well again it's about the same question but, I think it gives it gives some perspective in the work.  So it's a system for which we will re-observe, ask more telescope time to perform more observation, because if we confirm that it's a planet in formation then it becomes very important to follow up.  So to monitor the system, make sure that it's a planet, make sure that it rotates around the star, et cetera.


((WN))  What were some of the challenges the team faced during the study?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  The challenges?


((WN))  Yes.


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Um.  Well the challenges [are]: first, to get very good observation; and, well you know, when you observe at the telescope, sometimes the conditions are good, sometimes they are not so good.  And I think we were very lucky to have very good — extremely good condition, in fact.  So the fact that we see very clearly something is also related to the quality of the data, the quality of the telescope, of the instruments.  So that's the first challenge to get the data with a very good quality.  And then the second challenge is to compare the observation with the models.  Because there are many models.  Some are more or less complex.  Some are very detailed.  Some are less detailed.  And you have to figure out which one is the most appropriate for the comparison.  Because you don't want to make an interpretation that is too far.  You don't want to conclude something that is not very correct.  So you need also to make sure that you use the right model.  And so, you use one of the models that exists.  It's not the most sophisticated.  It's the one, on the opposite, which is almost the simplest.  Because it's enough to interpret the images, in fact.  So now, of course we need to think about models that are more detailed in order to explain the observations.


((WN))  Which technologies were used on this study?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  So we use a technology called adaptive optics which is something which is integrated into the instrument which is able to correct for the atmospheric turbulence.  So, when the light from the star cross[es] the atmosphere of the Earth, it becomes blurred.  And we are correcting this blurring in order to have very very fine detail on the images.  So that's one of the one of the technolog[ies] we are using.


The second one is coronagraphy.  So exactly like a system which is able to observe the Sun Corona.  So you block: when you block the Sun and you try to see around the Sun, well it's the same sort of technology but applied to stars instead of the Sun.  So all the stars — and so the stars are much smaller — and this system is able to block the light from the star, so you can see everywhere around, and look for planets, look for discs, look for structures.  These are the two main technologies we used.


((WN))  Why were these two technologies ideal for this study?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Oh, um yeah, it's not the only ones but yeah, they are necessary to perform this study, definitely.  Yeah.


((WN))  What makes this study unique?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well, it's not unique because we have already many observation of planetary systems.  We have a lot of observation of disks — protoplanetary disks — and especially SPHERE has observed a lot of them.  We also have images of planets.  And we know that planet are forming inside disks: inside protoplanetary disks.  And we know that planet should generate structures like spirals in a disk.  So we knew from the theory that planet and spirals are connected, but we never ever made the connection between the two.  So we never observed in the same system a planet and the spiral, ok.  So here, we don't have exactly observed that because we did not detect the planet, but we detected the presence of the planet in the structure of the spiral.  So we are getting one step closer to making the connection between the planet and the spirals, and the structures in the disk.


((WN))  What is currently the best explanation for the formation of exoplanets?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  There are several scenarios for forming exoplanets and we have only — we never witness planet formation, so we only have theories, which are based on a lot of observations, of course, including observations of the Solar System, planet in the Solar System, et cetera.  The analysis of rocks on the Earth as well in the Solar System.  But we [have] never seen a planet forming.  So, there are several theories.  One of them is that you have rocks forming into the system.  And these rocks are colliding, they are making bigger rocks. Bigger and bigger.  And when this rock has reached a mass which is large enough, like maybe ten times the mass of the Earth, then this big rock, this big planet, starts to accrete the gas.  And it becomes a giant planet like Jupiter or Saturn.  So that's the theory for forming a giant planet.


There are other way to form telluric planet, rocky planet, like the Earth.  But here, in fact, the [case] we were talking about — if it is a planet, it's necessarily a planet that is big like Jupiter, or maybe even bigger.  So we believe that the planet form first: the rock of the core of the planet is forming first.  And when the core is formed, then it accretes the gas, which literally falls on the core of the planet, and it makes a bigger planet: which is a gas giant planet.


((WN))  So what kind of exoplanet will this be if this planet forms?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  It will be a giant planet, really.  Maybe even bigger than Jupiter.  Maybe 10 times the mass of Jupiter.  But it couldn't be a planet that is like the Earth.  If it were a planet like the Earth, it wouldn't make this kind of spiral.  The spiral would not be detectable, in that case.  So it's necessarily a very big planet.


((WN))  So, is it safe to conclude that it could be a hot Jupiter?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  No, it's not a hot Jupiter.  Because, well hot Jupiter means two different type[s] of planets.  Jupiter can be hot if it is very close to the star.  And this is usually what we refer when we say hot Jupiter.  But, when a planet like Jupiter is forming, then the temperature is very high.  It's like one thousand, maybe two thousand degrees.  So, it's also a hot Jupiter.  But not because it's close to the star: because it's young, okay.  So here, we are talking about a young Jupiter planet which is probably very warm.


((WN))  What do we know about the planetary system that is being formed?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well we don't know much, in fact.  [laughs]  We know we know a little bit about the edge of the system.  We know the quantity of gas and dust that is there, and which will form planets anyway.  But we don't know yet how many planets are formed; if this planet will survive, et cetera.  So there's still a lot to be understood about this system.


((WN))  Why do you think this planet may not survive?  [...]  As you mentioned we do not know if this planet is going to survive.


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Yeah, because some planets: some planet form in the disk, okay.  If you have a planet forming in the disk, then the disk is made of gas.  And when the planet rotate[s] around the star, then there is a friction with the gas.  And so the planet slow[s] down.  And when it slow[s] down, it gets closer to the star.  And eventually, it can be a hot Jupiter.  And sometimes, it can even disappear into the star: swallowed by the star.  So we know that some planets are forming in systems and they finally end up merging with the star.  They disappear
into the star.  So we don't know if all planets survive, in fact.  Well this one is probably like 30 astronomical units [an astronomical unit is the distance from the Sun to the Earth, about 150 million km; 93 million miles] away from the star.  So it's very far away.  There's not a lot of change for this planet to migrate very close and disappear in the star.  But we know that it can happen.


((WN))  Could you tell us more about the host star?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  The star is more massive than the Sun.  It's 2.4 times the mass of the Sun [mass of Sun = about 2×1030 kg].  It's also very young, as I said, only a few million years.  Yeah.  Essentially that's the two parameters.


((WN))  And what do we know about the history of the system?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Not much.  [laugh]  Unfortunately, not much.  No.  We don't even have an exact measurement of the age.  Because it can be between like one and five million years old.  So it's not very accurate.


((WN))  This host star is a Herbig Ae star, right?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Yeah, yeah.


((WN))  What are some of the typical characteristics of a Herbig Ae star?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  They are very bright.  Because they are very massive, so it's essentially the mass of the star which makes it an Herbig star.  And they have also a lot of emissions.  So, when we started observing star with spectrograph, we realised that it had signatures in the spectrum, and in fact, the reason why they have signature is because they have an environment of gas.  So, the light from the star is traveling through the gas, and creates some absorption, or emission in some cases.  And we see this is a signature in the spectrum.  So, the fact that it's a Herbig Ae star means in fact, that it is surrounded by a disk.


((WN))  How common are these stars?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Oh, I don't have a clear idea of that.  [laughs]  [I] cannot answer.


((WN))  And how often do Herbig stars have orbiting planets?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  I don't know if we have already example.  I don't think we have many example[s] of planets around the Herbig Ae star.  It could be it could be one of the first, in fact, yeah.  Not many.


((WN))  As you mentioned, the spot formation of this potential planet is quite far from the host star — 30 astronomical units — what does the distance between this spiral and the star tell us?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well it tells us that planet[s] can form at 30 astronomical units.  That's already: I mean if it is really a planet in formation then it forms at 30 astronomical unit.  Which is not of use, in fact.  And, in fact, we never, as I said before, we never witnessed a planet at formation.  So it tells us that really, a planet can form at such a distance from the star.  In the Solar System, 30 astronomical unit is very far.  It's the orbit of Neptune.  But this one is not the Solar System; it's not the Sun.  It's more massive than the Sun.  So, 30 astronomical units — it's far away, but not not as far as in the Solar System, okay.  But at least we see that it's possible to form as a planet at this position.


((WN))  In what ways will this distance affect the planet formation?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  I don't know.  Well, we don't have a clear idea of that.


((WN))  Were there any unique traits in the orbit of the system?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  The orbit?  No.  Well we don't have the orbit yet.  I mean, we just have an image, and we don't have the full orbit yet.  So, we don't really know yet what is the orbit.


((WN))  When did you first consider the possibility of it being a birth of an exoplanet, rather than being something else?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well, as I said it's when we started to realise that the image was very similar to the models.  So, it's a suspicion that it should be a planet forming.  Although it's not a firm conclusion, of course.


((WN))  What other plausible hypothesis of what this twist might be?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  It could be a more massive object.  It could be a brown dwarf.  It could be a star also; it's unlikely, but it could be a star.  It could be also just what we call instabilities in a system.  So not always related to planets.  But other sort of instability.  A planet is somehow an instability because, while it rotates in the disk of gas, it disrupts the disk, the gas and create an instability.  But an instability can arise also for other reasons than a planet.


((WN))  And how do they rule out the other possibilities?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well, we're not completely ruling out the other possibilities.  If it were a star, it should have been visible as a star.  So, we believe it's not a star.  Well, at least it's not likely.  And this is why we believe it should be a planet.  Something that we don't see directly.  We don't detect it.


((WN))  Is there a possibility this system might form multiple exoplanets?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Yes, definitely.  Definitely.  Because we see a lot of spirals.  And if each of the spiral was actually a planet, then that means a lot of planets.  So in principle, when a system from one planet, there is no reason for not forming other planets.


((WN))  And how many exoplanets are we talking about?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Oh, we don't know. [laughs] We don't know at all.


((WN))  What does the analysis of radiation emission spectrum of the system reveal?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  In fact it's difficult, because it's not straightforward to measure the emission because of the disk.  So the disk has a lot of structures and so it's difficult to measure the flux from the planet.  And in fact, we believe that we are not able to detect the flux of the planet.  And this is why we conclude that we don't see the planet.  So we see only the flux from the gas and the dust in the system, but not from the planet directly.


((WN))  What do we know about the composition of the dust and gas in the spiral?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well, we know that there are molecules in this system; like carbon monoxide, for instance.  Certainly also a lot of hydrogen, of course.  And for the dust, it can be any kind of dust because we don't have very strong constraints.  So in fact, the dust that we see with SPHERE is different than the dust that we will see with another telescope, because we are not using the same spectral range.  So with SPHERE's near-infrared we are sensitive to dust that have sizes of a few microns [1 micron = 0.001 mm] — little grains — and we don't see the other big grains, in fact.  It doesn't mean that they are not there.  It means that we don't have the sensitivity to see it.  So there's a whole distribution of dust; dust sizes.


((WN))  What kind of atmosphere will this potential planet [be] likely to have in future?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well certainly a gas planet; so with an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, in majority.


((WN))  How many spirals were observed?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  So in the central part we see at least two big spirals.  But in fact, all these spirals have little structures, so we see a lot of them.  But mostly in the very inner part.  And then, if you look at the very outer part, then you see a lot of a lot more spirals.  But we believe that these ones are not due to planets, but more to instabilities.


((WN))  Were these two spirals interfering?


((Anthony Boccaletti))   Um, yes, probably!  Probably.  Yeah, if you have more planets in the system, then they all launch spirals.  And all of them interfere.


((WN))  How big were these spirals?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  How big?  They can be several several hundreds of astronomical units.


((WN))  What does the next few million years for this system look like?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Probably that in one million year the planet will be formed.  And most of the gas will be dissipated.  So, all the disk we see in the image will disappear and we will be left with planets.  Or maybe it will take more than one million year.  Maybe five or ten.  That's the point.  We don't know exactly.


((WN))  If that is the case this will make it the youngest discovered exoplanet so far, right?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Yes, if it is an exoplanet, then it's the youngest, yeah.


((WN))  When do astronomers use near-infrared imaging of the stars?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well we use an infrared because it's the wavelength where we can use adaptive optics also.  So with adaptive optics, we can provide very detailed images.  And we need to resolve the very central part of system so we need adaptive optics.  So near-infrared is interesting because you can use adaptive optics, and also because it's the range where you expect a planet to be very bright.  If you look in the visible [light range], the planet will be very faint.


((WN))  How do you test your hypothesis?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  How do we test the hypothesis?  Of what — Of the planet?  Of the object being the planet?


((WN))  Yes.


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Well, again I think it's: at the moment the only test is to compare with the models.  That's the only thing we can do.


((WN))  What is your role at the Observatoire de Paris?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  I'm a researcher.  And I work on exoplanets and protoplanetary disks.  Yeah, mostly I work also on design of instruments.  I'm doing instrumentation and observations and interpretation of observations.


((WN))  Is your team planning to study more about this system?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Yes definitely.  We already asked for more telescope time to re-observe AB Aurigae.


((WN))  And what do you expect to find about the system this time?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  We would like to confirm first that the structure is still visible.  To see if it rotates around the star in a Keplerian motion.  And if the the shape of the spiral is stable or evolve[s] over time.


((WN))  What lies ahead to be discovered about exoplanets?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  A lot of things.  [laughs]  Many many many things, yeah.  [laughs]  It will be too long to describe what has to be done on exoplanets.  It's really a young science.  So, in particular, we need to understand how they form.  And what they are made of, also.


((WN))  Are we be likely to find more instances of planet formation in the near future?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Yeah, yes.  Definitely. We've instruments like SPHERE or GPI [Gemini Planet Imager] or other instruments that are installed on 8-meter telescopes.  Also with the next Space Telescope, James Webb, you will find out more planets.  The next big telescope on the Earth will be the extremely large telescope which is a 38-meter telescope.  So also we expect to find more planets.


((WN))  How can this discovery influence what we already know about planet formation?


((Anthony Boccaletti))   Again I think it's really because it's a very young system.  So we never really observe this stage with SPHERE.  We have done that with ALMA — with the instrument ALMA — we can observe very young system, but we don't see the same thing.  We see mostly big dust, and gas.  But with SPHERE, it's really new to be interested in very very young stars.


((WN))  What do we now know about planet formation that we didn't know before?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  What we learn is typically that a planet could form at 30 astronomical unit from a star, that is more massive than the Sun.  And that it has an impact on the distribution of the gas and the dust.  That's mostly what we learned.  And of course, this system is a cornerstone, and we'll probably observe more systems like AB Aurigae in the future.


((WN))  What are some of the other studies you are currently working on?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  That's typically on other systems that are a bit older than AB Aurigae, in fact.  Usually the stars we are observing with SPHERE are like 10 or 20 million years old.  It's basically — less than 50 million years old.  Between 10 and 50, say, million years.  And they have gas and dust around, so we can detect discs.  And so we are performing a survey of hundreds of stars to detect new planets.


((WN))  Well, those were all the questions I had for you.  Would you like to add anything?


((Anthony Boccaletti))  No. I think we we already covered the subject very much.  Thank you for your questions.


((WN))  Thank you for agreeing for this interview.  It has been a great pleasure discussing this with you.


((Anthony Boccaletti))  Oh, me too.  Thank you very much.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/11-month_old_baby_finds_illegal_drugs_in_playground_in_British_Columbia,_Canadian_police_report",2020-07-08,"11-month old baby finds illegal drugs in playground in British Columbia, Canadian police report","A mother called the police in Kamloops, British Columbia (B.C.), Canada on Sunday morning after her 11-month daughter discovered a bag full of a substance that appeared to be fentanyl, a dangerous opioid drug, according to Kamloops Police, at the McDonald Park playground. She managed to get a hold of the small bag and kept her child safe.


In a statement issued on Monday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) confirmed they seized the substance, stating ""In B.C., this has been considered a public health emergency since April 2016. Unfortunately this means issues like found needles and drugs are something that all parents must be mindful of while in public settings.""


Kamloops RCMP Constable Gary Gray said fentanyl had become a popular drug in Kamloops because it was potent, and colors such as purple were used as a signature by traffickers.


Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid crisis claimed 15,393 lives in Canada between January 2016 and December 2019, according to the Canadian Public Health Infobase.


In Ontario, provincial police Detective Constable Daniel Dubé stated to the CBC in late June that the border closure between New York State and Quebec drove up the prices of illicit drugs, and traffickers had been stretching their products further. He explained that heroin, which had normally been laced with fentanyl, had been mixed with the sedative etizolam, or benzos, another drug of the nervous system depressant class.


The Executive director of the Ask Wellness Society, Bob Hughes, told Kamloops This Week that CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) payments, a program related to the COVID-19 pandemic, presented an additional factor in a spike in overdose deaths this year. According to the B.C. Coroners Service, there were 170 suspected deaths in May alone, shortly after the CERB payments started, resulting from the abuse of illicit drugs. That showed a 93% increase from 88 deaths in May 2019. Clinic and advocacy manager Michaela Jyrkkanen, of Christian anti-poverty organization The Mustard Seed Kamloops, disagreed with the correlation between the overdoses and the CERB payments.


Last year, Vancouver researchers distributed take-home test strip kits which were capable of detecting fentanyl presence in other drugs. Dr Sukhpreet Klaire, the lead author of the study and an addiction medicine specialist, said the cost of the accurate test strip kit was 75 cents. More than 95% of the participants in her study indicated they would use the strip kits again.

He was reported missing Thursday evening by the police.  Park was 64 years old.


Park Won-soon's body was found at Mount Bukak.  According to initial reports, the police have been investigating the specifics about the cause of his death.


According to local reports, the 64-year-old mayor left his home a quarter before 11 a.m. on Thursday with a backpack.  At about 5:17 p.m. his daughter reported to the police he ""left home four–five hours ago after leaving words like a will, with his phone currently off."" ((ko))Korean language: ‍4~5시간 전에 아버지가 유언 같은 말을 남기고 집을 나갔는데 전화기가 꺼져 있다  Park's phone was last active in the north-east region of Seoul in Seongbuk-gu, The Korea Herald reported.


The Seoul government said Park had cancelled his entire Thursday schedule.


A large search operation was launched, involving over 500 police officers and firefighters. 


Shortly before Park Won-soon's death, on Wednesday a case was reportedly filed against him by a former secretery concerning sexual harassment, and the police had said they would be investigating the allegations.


Park was elected mayor of the capital city in 2011.  He was re-elected twice, in 2014 and 2018.  His current term was through 2021.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Serbian_protesters_try_to_storm_Parliament;_fourth_day_of_protests,2020-07-12,Serbian protesters try to storm Parliament; fourth day of protests,"Friday night was the fourth night in a row that Serbians protested; the protest started out against the government's anti-COVID-19 measures but has reportedly expanded into more general anti-government protests. Police director Vladimir Rebic said at least 71 people were arrested Friday night.


Anti-government protests have been taking place since Tuesday in the Serbian capital Belgrade after the government announced new lockdown measures, which the government dropped after the protests began.  According to reports, criticism within Serbia has said COVID-19 cases rose because President Aleksandar Vučić eased lockdown measures to win elections which were held on June 21.  Public and private gatherings were allowed in May again before the election started, including sports events, religious events, and parties.


The protesters clashed in front of parliament with the police and threw rocks, bottles and flares. As they tried to storm parliament, police in response fired tear gas at them.  Director Rebic said the night's incidents injured fourteen police officers. A number of journalists were also injured after being attacked by protesters.


Some members of opposition parties have claimed violent protesters were sent by the government. President Vučić said  unspecified foreign security forces were involved in the protests.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/On_the_campaign_trail_in_the_USA,_June_2020",2020-07-25,"On the campaign trail in the USA, June 2020","The following is the second edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.


This month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the Prohibition Party, Reform Party, and the Life and Liberty Party.


As the campaign entered June, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who mathematically secured the nomination of his party with victories in the June 2 primaries, led President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, 49.0 percent to 42.2 percent in the RealClearPolitics average.


Protests and riots related to the death of George Floyd continued across the nation.  During a riot in Washington, D.C. near the White House, rioters reportedly partly set fire to St. John’s Episcopal Church at Lafayette Square, which suffered damage. The next day, with protests ongoing, President Trump delivered a speech declaring himself the ""president of law and order."" Afterwards he walked to the church.  Before doing so, law enforcement cleared reportedly peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square using tear gas.  Trump walked and upon reaching the Church held up a Bible for a photo-op.  He received criticism for the move.   Protests escalated later in June with the police killing of Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta.  Charges were promptly filed against the officers involved. Atlanta's Democratic mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms's handling of the incident raised her vice presidential prospects.  With the issue of race at the forefront of the campaign, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota withdrew her name from consideration to be Biden's running mate.  She endorsed the selection of a ""woman of color.""  At the time, Bottoms, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Congresswoman Val Demings,  New Mexico governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren were said to be finalists for the Democratic vice presidential nomination.

Also as a result of the protests, the slogan ""Defund the Police"" became popular among supporters of Black Lives Matter.  The Minneapolis city council voted to disband its police force. And in some cities, most notably in Seattle, protesters set up police-free autonomous zones.  CHAZ (Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone) or CHOP (Capitol Hill Occupied Protests) as it was later known, formed in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. The Trump campaign connected the ""defund"" slogan and lawlessness to Biden.  In addition, rioters started to tear down and vandalize public statues.  They vandalized, toppled, and/or destroyed statues of figures associated with the Confederate States of America, and statues of Christopher Columbus, US presidents George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant, and abolitionist Matthias Baldwin. Law enforcement halted attempts to take down an equestrial statue of US President Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square.  Ahead of a planned attempt to take down the Emancipation Memorial featuring US President Abraham Lincoln in Lincoln Park, Trump vowed to issue an executive order regarding those caught desecrating federal statues.  Trump railed against the rioters during his first campaign rally since the coronavirus pandemic fully engaged the United States, on June 20 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The rally did not require face masks, which led to criticism over concerns about spreading coronavirus.  Attendance was underwhelming with empty seats visible.  Trump created controversy during the rally with a statement about coronavirus testing resulting in an uptick in the number of infections counted.  Although the rate of deaths from coronavirus decreased, infections increased in certain states, resulting in a slowdown in reopening.  Due to the pandemic, the planned Republican National Convention moved from Charlotte to Jacksonville.  The Democratic Party planned to hold its convention largely online.


On June 23, Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton released a book, The Room Where It Happened, critical of Trump.  The administration sued to stop publication, claiming the book had not yet been fully checked for classified information.  A judge agreed the book may have contained classified materials but ruled that ""the damage is done"" with advanced copies made available to the media. Notably, in the book, Bolton claims Trump asked Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping for help in the 2020 election, which Trump denied. Trump said Bolton broke the law and ""likes dropping bombs on people, and killing them.""  Democrats expressed dissatisfaction with Bolton over his unwillingness to testify at the Trump impeachment proceedings.  In interviews promoting the book, Bolton said he would not vote for Trump or Biden but planned to write-in an alternate candidate instead.  In alternate party news, businessman Rocky De La Fuente, already the presidential nominee of the Alliance Party, was named the presidential nominee of both the Reform Party and the Natural Law Party of Michigan. The parties nominated his running mate, historian Darcy Richardson, for vice president. The newly created Life and Liberty Party, a libertarian-leaning anti-abortion party, held its first national convention and nominated a ticket of activist J. R. Myers for president and professor Tiara Lusk for vice president.In the Green Party, union leader and party co-founder Howie Hawkins attained the number of delegates required to secure the Green Party presidential nomination ahead of the party's national convention in July.


At the end of the month, Biden held his first press conference since the pandemic was just starting in the United States.  At the event, he broached the New York Times report that Russians were paying bounties to the Taliban to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan.Trump described the story as possibly a hoax and the White House claimed it did not brief Trump on the matter. Biden, during his conference, also countered claims about his mental acuity, declaring that he ""can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I'm running against.""  Nevertheless, with more gaffes in June including the misstatement that 120 million people had died from coronavirus, opposition questions about Biden's alleged mental decline continued.  A Zogby International poll showed 55 percent of respondents believed Biden to be in the early stages of dementia.  Still, he remained well ahead of Trump in opinion polls as the month came to a close. In the RealClearPolitics average at the end of June, Biden led Trump 50.0 percent to 40.4 percent. 


In June, Prohibition Party presidential nominee Phil Collins and vice presidential nominee Billy Joe Parker unsuccessfully sought the nomination of the Reform Party, thereby denying ballot access for the ticket in Florida.  However, the Prohibition Party has access in Mississippi and Arkansas and is attempting to appear on the ballot in Vermont, Colorado, and Tennessee.  In addition, Collins won the American Independent Party's California Primary in March. Their victory does not guarantee Collins/Parker the party's nomination and a place on the California ballot. The Prohibition Party has not attained ballot access in five or more states since 1984.  In 2016, the party's ticket of James Hedges for President and Bill Bayes for Vice President appeared on the ballot in three states and received 5,617 votes. 


Collins/Parker was not the Prohibition Party's original 2020 presidential ticket.  In November 2018, the party nominated a ticket of Bayes for President and C.L. Gammon for Vice President. Bayes withdrew in March 2019. The next month, the party nominated a new ticket of Gammon for President and Collins for Vice President. Gammon withdrew due to health reasons around the beginning of August 2019.  The party finally settled on the Collins/Parker ticket later that month. Parker is a former Marine who worked in manufacturing and warehousing jobs until retiring in 2002.  Since then he has been active in the anti-alcohol movement. 


Parker spoke with Wikinews about the campaign.  He discussed why he ultimately decided to join the Prohibition Party, what he sees as his duties and responsibilities as the vice presidential nominee, and why voters should consider voting for the Collins/Parker ticket.


((WSS))  When did you join the Prohibition Party and what attracted you to it?


((WSS))  What duties and responsibilities come with your role as the vice presidential nominee of the Prohibition Party?


((WSS))  Why should voters consider voting for the Collins/Parker ticket over others on the ballot?


At the virtual 2020 Reform National Convention on June 20, the Reform Party nominated the De La Fuente/Richardson presidential ticket, granting it ballot access in Florida. Three days later, the ballot- qualified Natural Law Party of Michigan gave its nomination to the duo. De La Fuente/Richardson has already secured the nomination of the Alliance Party, giving it ballot access in Delaware, South Carolina, and possibly Connecticut.  Wikinews reached out to Richardson to discuss the campaign.


Richardson is a political activist and historian who has authored many books on past political campaigns. He owns the political website Uncovered Politics.  In the 1988 presidential election, Richardson served as campaign manager for the late US Senator Eugene McCarthy. Richardson himself entered presidential politics when he challenged President Barack Obama for the Democratic Party's 2012 presidential nomination. He sought the Reform Party's 2016 presidential nomination but lost to his 2020 running mate De La Fuente. In 2018, Richardson ran for governor of Florida as the Reform Party nominee and finished in third place. 


With Wikinews, Richardson discussed his role as the running mate of De La Fuente, the complexity of being the vice presidential nominee for so many parties simultaneously, and for what the De La Fuente/Richardson ticket stands.


((WSS))  What are your duties and responsibilities as the running mate of Rocky De La Fuente?


((WSS))  De La Fuente/Richardson is the ticket of the Alliance, Reform, Natural Law, and American Delta parties. What can the De La Fuente campaign do to grow these parties? Is the campaign focused more on growing one party over the others?


((WSS))  What does the De La Fuente/Richardson ticket stand for? What unique issues or ideas should a voter associate with the campaign?


On June 27, via Zoom, the Life and Liberty Party (L&L) held its first national convention.  It nominated conservative activist J. R. Myers of Alaska for president.  For vice president, three candidates sought the party's nomination. With 71 percent of the vote, Tiara Lusk of Idaho was victorious. Wikinews contacted Lusk about her designation as the first vice presidential nominee of the Life and Liberty Party.


Lusk teaches business management as an adjunct professor at Western Nevada College. She served as a delegate at the Republican Party of Idaho's 2018 convention and as a delegate at the Constitution Party's 2020 national convention.  In addition, she chaired region six of the Constitution Party of Idaho. 


The Life and Liberty Party formed from former members of the Constitution Party.  It has attained ballot access in Arkansas and is currently petitioning in several other states.  As of late June, several state Constitution parties were considering severing their ties with the national Constitution Party, which nominated Don Blankenship for president in May.    According to Politics1.com, some of these states may attempt to give their nomination and ballot access to the Myers/Lusk ticket. 


With Wikinews, Lusk discussed why she joined the Life and Liberty Party, what her role as vice presidential nominee entails, and why voters should choose the Myers/Lusk ticket over other conservative tickets.


((WSS))  What is the Life and Liberty Party? How is it different from the Constitution Party?  And why did you decide to seek its vice presidential nomination?


((WSS))  What are your duties and responsibilities as the vice presidential nominee of the Life and Liberty Party?


((WSS))  Why should right wing or conservative voters choose Myers/Lusk over President Trump or the Constitution Party's Blankenship/Mohr ticket?

On Thursday, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, an opposition candidate for the Belarusian presidential election to be held on August 9, held a rally in Minsk, Belarus.  The rally was visited by several tens of thousands of people, and was reportedly one of the biggest political events in Belarus in a decade.


According to reports from the ministry of internal affairs of Belarus on Friday, and Vyasna, an independent Belarusian human rights center, on Thursday, around 18,250 to 63,000 visitors attended the rally.  A main issue discussed was the liberation of political prisoners arrested during the campaign.


The rally started around 18:00 local time (1500 UTC). During the first two hours, friends and relatives of political prisoners spoke.  Belarusian musicians made performances between their speeches.


Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya arrived at at about 20:00. She spoke about her husband Siarhei, who was arrested in May, and promised to conduct new completely fair elections and hold a constitutional referendum to cancel all amendments issued by the current president, Alexander Lukashenko, since 1995.  She asked for support, specially asking voters to vote at the polls, not before election day.  Maria Kalesnikava spoke, who headed the campaign of Viktar Babaryka, who was arrested and banned from the election; and Veranika Tsapkala, wife of Valery Tsapkala, a potential presidential candidate who fled the country.


Within roughly a day before the event, Belarusian KGB arrested 33 Russian individuals, claiming them to be mercenaries, who allegedly were preparing to organize ""terrorism"" in association with the election.  The government strengthened security measures during the rally.

Air India Express flight 1344 (AXB1344/IX1344) was en-route from Dubai, UAE making its second attempt at a landing at Calicut during monsoon rains. The flight was part of the Vande Bharat Mission to return Indian nationals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aircraft was a Boeing 737.


According to the National Disaster Response Force, Calicut has a tabletop runway, so when the aircraft failed to stop on the runway, it fell into a ditch or gorge. The aircraft broke into two pieces but did not catch fire, according to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. There were 190 people on board, six of them crew members.


Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said 18 people died. 149 of the survivors have been hospitalized. Hardeep also stated that both of the flight recorders have been recovered.


Among the dead are both the pilot and co-pilot. The local health minister said, ""The injured persons have been rushed to Kozhikode Medical College and other nearby hospitals. Those admitted are having serious injuries.""


Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote, ""My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover at the earliest. [...] Authorities are at the spot, providing all assistance to the affected.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Biden_announces_Kamala_Harris_as_2020_running_mate_in_US_presidential_race,2020-08-12,Biden announces Kamala Harris as 2020 running mate in US presidential race,"Yesterday, Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for President of the United States, announced Kamala Harris as his choice for running mate in the 2020 United States presidential election.


Biden wrote that ""I've decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021"".


Harris, a sitting U.S. Senator from California, is the former Attorney General of California as well as a one of Biden's former rivals for the Democratic Party's nomination. She also previously served as the district attorney for the city of San Francisco.


In March, at the Democratic Party's final presidential debate, Biden announced his plan to choose a woman to be his running mate, saying ""I commit that I will in fact pick a woman to be vice president"". A tweet sent from Biden's Twitter account during the debate repeated Biden's commitment, saying ""My running mate will be a woman. #DemDebate"".


If elected, Harris would be the first woman to serve as Vice President of the United States. She would be the third woman to be a major US political party's vice presidential nominee. In 2008, then-governor of Alaska Sarah Palin was chosen by John McCain as his running mate, making her the Republican Party's first female candidate for Vice President.


In 1984, Geraldine Ferraro was Walter Mondale's running mate on the Democratic Party ticket, making Ferraro the Democratic Party's first female candidate for Vice President and Harris the party's second. Eight years earlier, at the 1972 Democratic National Convention, Gloria Steinem received 400 votes for the party's vice presidential nomination, coming in second.


Biden himself served eight years as vice president from 2009 to 2017, under Barack Obama's administration.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Water_main_bursts_in_White_Plains,_New_York,_US",2020-08-13,"Water main bursts in White Plains, New York, US","On Monday, a water main broke in the US city of White Plains, New York, cutting off the water supply to most of the city. The burst pipe caused a huge crater to form in a major intersection in the heart of the city, flooding the streets. Emergency crews were on the scene to repair the pipes in order to restore water service. Almost all customers had water restored by the evening.


The water pipe burst under the road surface at the intersection of Martine Avenue and S. Lexington Avenue in the afternoon. By 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC) the city issued an advisory of water outages and stated the Department of Public Works (DPW) had located the problem. Wikinews was on the scene around 6:20 pm and could observe a large crater in the street caused by the amount of water from the burst pipe. Crews from DPW as well as some the fire department were there. Water was no longer rushing uncontrolled into the street.



Shortly thereafter, at 6:30 pm, the city issued a follow-up statement announcing the break had been contained by DPW. Residents were advised to expect the water to perhaps be ""discolored"" when it initially returned. The city estimated by 9 pm, there would be enough pressure returned to the water system for all to have water. Indeed, News 12 reported, only buildings adjacent to the break were without water service.


White Plains is the county seat for Westchester County, New York, which is also home to the cities New Rochelle and Yonkers which formed the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in New York. Westchester lies directly to the north of New York City.

""I am [pretty happy with that]"", Caloundra coach Geoff Ingram said.  ""We made a lot of ground on where we were [in the] last couple of weeks. [...] Set piece and breakdown, they've been the two missing pieces [in the] last couple of weeks.  We got away with it against Uni [in round 1] but [against] Noosa [in round 2], we didn't.  They beat us well.  It was probably a set piece was the weak point  against Uni, and then [the] breakdown was the issue against Noosa.  They were good good couple of early lessons and we made  big ground on that gap today.""


Maroochydore captain Sam Marshall lamented his side's close loss.


""Yeah, it didn't come our way, we had a few silly mistakes"", Marshall said.  ""A couple of yellows [and] disciplines. [...] We're training really well together, as a unit we're gelling.  We're just bringing silly mistakes and errors on to the field.  I think those are things we have to work on.""


The home side was on the receiving end of two yellow cards, leaving Ingram unimpressed.  ""One of them was questionable.  But there's a lazy high shot from Kauri at the end which was a fair yellow, the other one probably not.""

Navalny has been suffering from a serious medical condition since Thursday. His associates have alleged Navalny was poisoned.


Alexei Navalny is an outspoken critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Navalny was transferred from the hospital in Omsk to Charité in Berlin via air ambulance. Cinema for Peace Foundation, a Berlin-based non-profit, provided for the medical evacuation.


On Thursday, Navalny was flying from Tomsk in Siberia headed for Moscow when he fell ill. The flight was redirected to Omsk, so he could be hospitalized. Associates of Navalny alleged he drank tea laced with poison. Hospital officials in Omsk said no traces of poison was found in his blood or urine. As of Friday, Navalny was in a medically induced coma.


Charité said in a statement, Navalny would be undergoing extensive medical diagnostics. His family would be consulted before any comment on his condition would be released. The hospital also asked for patience.

""It's a better performance than what we put on last week"", Wynnum coach Matt Myers said. ""We're a forty or fifty minute team at the moment, not an eighty minute team.

Caloundra half back Jarrod Kidston enjoyed the win. ""Yeah it was a good start from us, probably the best start from us in a while"", Kidston said. ""Then we just made a couple of mistakes and let them back in the game. They're a good outfit so they put points on pretty quick.""


The visitors would run away with the result in the end. ""We got back on even and managed to go try for try for a couple"", Myers said. ""[We] let them [have the] momentum [and they were] over the top, they got a roll on"".


Fitness was a big factor in that according to Kidston. ""We've been working hard on our fitness so it was pretty good to get the points at the back end"", he said.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/On_the_campaign_trail_in_the_USA,_July_2020",2020-08-31,"On the campaign trail in the USA, July 2020","The following is the third edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.


This month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the American Solidarity Party, the Bread and Roses Party, and the Unity Party of America.


As the campaign reached July, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden led incumbent President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.7 percent to 40.3 percent.


On July 1, the city of Seattle cleared the autonomous CHAZ/CHOP (Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone/Capitol Hill Organized Protest).  Nevertheless, civil unrest including the toppling of statues, still stemming from the police killing of George Floyd in May, continued elsewhere in the US. President Trump sent Department of Homeland Security officers to protect federal buildings in Portland.  Biden criticized the move, arguing Trump was ""sow[ing] chaos and division"" and ""mak[ing] matters worse.""  The Trump campaign accused Biden of ""siding with criminals."" Trump maintained the campaign theme of law and order.  While the nation continued to suffer through the coronavirus pandemic, the President traveled to South Dakota, which, unlike most states, had not enacted a stay-at-home order, to take part in a celebration at Mount Rushmore on the eve of Independence Day.  He delivered a speech in which he condemned rioters who desecrate statues and memorials throughout the nation.  In addition, he announced the creation of a special park with statues to honor historic US figures.  Most attendees at the event did not practice social distancing or wear face masks.   The next day, Trump held a Fourth of July ""Salute to America"" in Washington, D.C. in which he delivered another speech. Joe Biden forewent traditional holiday activities as an added precaution against COVID-19.  That same day, rapper Kanye West made a surprise announcement on Twitter that he, himself, was running for president.  In an interview with Forbes, West outlined his campaign.  He named Wyoming preacher Michelle Tidball as his running mate and introduced the Birthday Party as the vehicle for his run. His platform included anti-abortion views. West backed away from his previous support for President Trump, expressing disappointment at reports Trump hid in the White House basement during riots.  He leveled greater criticism at Biden, saying he was not ""special"" like himself, Trump, and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The interviewer questioned whether West was running to help President Trump defeat Biden. West did not deny the suggestion.  After the interview, a spokesman for West claimed West decided to drop out of the race.  However, subsequently, West officially filed with the FEC and secured a place on the ballot in Oklahoma with a US$35,000 payment.   Two other Independent presidential candidates also paid the fee to qualify for the Oklahoma ballot: child actor and entrepreneur Brock Pierce; plus pianist and pageant participant Jade Simmons.  West, in an interview with a Charleston, South Carolina radio station, floated Simmons as a potential running mate, arguing  Tidball could be used in a different capacity.  He identified fellow rapper Jay-Z as his ideal running mate.  West held his first campaign rally in Charleston, where he tearfully discussed potentially aborting his first child with wife Kim Kardashian, screaming ""I almost killed my daughter!""  He proposed a US$1 million payment for those who give birth to children rather than aborting.  At this time, West's family reportedly expressed concerns about West's mental state.  The next day on Twitter West accused his wife of attempting to ""lock me up"" due to his comments at the rally.


In a July 9 speech in Pennsylvania, Biden introduced an economic plan called ""Build Back Better"" designed to reinvigorate the US economy in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Build Back Better"" is, like Trump's ""America First"" plan, a form of economic nationalism.  ""Build Back Better"" calls for an increase in corporate taxes among economic incentives to ""Buy American.""  Biden claimed the plan would create five million US jobs. Trump encouraged public schools to reopen classes in-person at summer's end.  He threatened to withhold federal funds from districts that did not comply.  Trump later softened his stance, acknowledging that circumstances may require delaying some school reopenings.  In addition, for the first time, Trump was pictured wearing a face mask.  As cases of coronavirus increased in Florida, Trump cancelled the in-person Republican National Convention planned for Jacksonville.  Instead, like the Democratic National Convention  Republicans opted to hold their convention in a largely virtual format.  The Libertarian Party held the second half of its convention partially in-person in Orlando.  Although the party had already nominated the ticket of professor Jo Jorgensen for president and podcaster Spike Cohen for vice president at the virtual convention in May, party business still needed to be completed.  At the same time, the Green Party held its national convention virtually and nominated the ticket of party co-founder and union leader Howie Hawkins for president and truck driver Angela Walker for vice president.   


In mid-July, Trump commuted the prison sentence of confidante Roger Stone.  Stone had been found guilty of several crimes including false statements to investigators as part of Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election.  Trump called Stone's 40 month sentence ""unjust.""  The Biden campaign criticized the commutation as an abuse of power, pointing to the ""ballot box"" as the only way to stop Trump.  Several days later, Trump's niece Mary Trump released the tell-all book Too Much and Never Enough.  The book alleges, among other things, that Trump paid his friend Joe Shapiro to take the SAT for him before his admission to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.  Shapiro's widow, former tennis player Pam Shriver, said her husband had told her Trump had not met Shapiro until being admitted to Wharton. The July 17 death of Democratic Congressman John Lewis, a prominent civil rights leader, had a major impact on the second half of the month.  The death brought the issue of civil rights back to the forefront of the campaign.  Lewis's colleague and leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman Karen Bass emerged as a significant contender to be Biden's running mate, joining Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Tammy Duckworth as potential candidates.  Trump did not attend Lewis's viewing or funeral.  Three former presidents including Barack Obama attended the funeral.  During his eulogy, Obama took a veiled shot at Trump for his attacks on mail-in voting, which critics, like Obama, have said amounted to voter suppression.  As the funeral progressed, Trump tweeted about possibly delaying the 2020 election due to his concerns about potential fraud from widespread mail-in balloting instituted due to the pandemic.  Biden attacked Trump for the tweet, claiming he used it to distract from Lewis's funeral.  In honor of Lewis, Biden said once in office he would immediately sign the renewal of the Voting Rights Act, renamed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. On the day of the funeral, the co-chair of Black Voices for Trump and 2012 presidential candidate, Herman Cain, who, like Trump, ran for president on his business credentials, died from COVID-19.  He had attended Trump's Tulsa rally in June without a mask and first received hospital treatment for COVID-19 on July 1.  Trump lauded Cain as a ""powerful voice of freedom."" 


As July came to a close, Biden’s lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics average slightly decreased, with Biden registering 49.9 percent to 42.1 percent for Trump. 


In July, the American Solidarity Party's ticket of retired teacher Brian T. Carroll for president and high school teacher Amar Patel for vice president, qualified, through petition, for ballot access in Illinois.  The party has expanded upon its ballot access from 2016 when its first ticket of Mike Maturen for president and Juan Muñoz for vice president appeared on the ballot only in Colorado, receiving a total of 6,776 votes, largely from write-ins in other states.


The party was founded in 2011 as the Christian Democratic Party. It changed to its current name ahead of the 2016 presidential election.  The party is based on Roman Catholic social teachings, advocating for social justice, environmentalism, and ""a consistent life ethic""
including opposition to abortion, euthanasia, and capital punishment.  It has grown ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
Last September the party nominated Carroll for president over past Wikinews interviewee Joe Schriner and Joshua Perkins who also sought the party's nomination. Carroll selected Patel as his running mate. Patel, the son of Indian immigrants, is a high school teacher in the Chicago suburbs. He converted to Catholicism in 1993 and engaged with the Knights of Columbus. He became involved in the pro-life movement and, in association with that, the Republican Party, but grew disillusioned with the party over the war policies of the George W. Bush administration.  Eventually, Patel joined the Solidarity Party and rose to the position of chairman


Patel spoke with Wikinews about the campaign. He discussed how he became the vice presidential nominee of the Solidarity Party, what he sees as his duties and responsibilities as Carroll's running mate, and why voters should consider voting for the Carroll/Patel ticket.

The Bread and Roses Party ticket of University of Maryland research scholar Jerome Segal for president and filmmaker John de Graaf for vice president secured a spot on the ballot in Vermont in July. The party had already achieved qualified status in Maryland.  It is seeking access only in non-swing states where a particular major party is heavily expected to win.  In swing states, to avoid the spoiler effect, the party supports the Democratic Party's presidential ticket. 


Segal founded the Bread and Roses Party since the last presidential election.  Its name derives from the rallying call of immigrant textile workers in Massachusetts during a 1912 strike.  The party holds leftist positions including the right to employment, paid vacation, a shortened work week, and recognition of the State of Palestine.  In August 2019 the party nominated Segal for president. He announced de Graaf as his running mate this past April.  As a filmmaker, de Graaf has produced 40 documentaries.  In addition, he has co-written four books, and has written numerous articles for such publications as The Progressive and The New York Times.


With Wikinews, de Graaf discusses why he joined the Bread and Roses Party, what his role as vice presidential nominee entails, and why voters in non-swing states should choose the Segal/de Graaf ticket over other options on the ballot.

The Unity Party of America ticket of Internet entrepreneur  Bill Hammons for president and engineer Eric Bodenstab for vice president secured ballot access in New Jersey in late July. The party had already attained ballot access in Colorado as a qualified minor party with at least 1,000 members. This is the first election cycle the party has fielded a presidential ticket.  


Hammons founded the Unity Party in 2004  and grew it through his 2008 and 2010 runs for US Congress, his 2014 and 2016 runs for US Senate, and his 2018 run for Governor of Colorado.  The party, which describes itself as centrist, advocates in its constitution for, among other things, a balanced budget amendment, elimination of the federal income tax, tax deduction for health care costs, a global minimum wage for fair trade, term limits for Congress and judges, lowering the voting age, DC statehood, and expanded space exploration. 


Bodenstab has previously run for city council and was the Unity Party's nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Colorado in 2018.  With Wikinews, Bodenstab discusses how he joined the Unity Party's presidential ticket, what constitutes his role as the party's vice presidential nominee, and why voters in the states the party has attained ballot access should consider casting their vote for the Hammons/Bodenstab ticket.

""We turned up here knowing we'd be in for a battle"", University coach Brad Tronc said. ""They pushed [reigning premiers] Caloundra and they pushed Noosa. We knew the were looking for a scalp. To Maroochydore's credit, they've made some big improvements since last season. I think as the season goes on they'll keep getting better and better, as well.""


The game was a hard, physical match according to Maroochydore assistant coach Ben Radmall. ""It was pretty set piece dominated there for the last twenty minutes"", Radmall said. ""[It was] a pretty physical game out there this afternoon. It was a good hit out. We're sore after that one.""


University were able to pull away in the second half despite an off day in front of goal.


""The two guys that set [Uni's final try] up were an 18 year old half back and an 18 year old five eighth,"" Tronc said.


Radmall conceded that his side needed to work on some things. ""We had our opportunities in the 22 in that last twenty minutes"", he said. ""Just some management, couple of set pieces let us down. We couldn't execute there and they exited pretty well. They slowed the game down pretty well in that last ten minutes to dance up the field and then score a try at the end there.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Tributes_paid_to_recently_deceased_US_actor_Chadwick_Boseman,2020-09-02,Tributes paid to recently deceased US actor Chadwick Boseman,"Over the weekend, tributes were paid to US actor Chadwick Boseman, including Sunday's commercial-free airing of Black Panther and a special retrospective about Boseman entitled ""A Tribute For a King"" by American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Boseman died on Friday after being diagnosed with colon cancer four years earlier. Boseman, who rose to international fame for his title role in the 2018 Marvel superhero film Black Panther, was 43 years old. 


Boseman died at home on August 28 in the company of his wife and family according to a statement posted to his official Twitter account. It also stated he was in stage IV of his cancer which had been diagnosed in 2016. His illness was not public information, even as he had undergone surgeries and chemotherapy to treat it, all the while continuing to work.


Boseman was born in South Carolina. He attended the British American Drama Academy (BADA) during his studies at Howard University from which he graduated in 2000. Early in his career, Boseman acted in television soap operas, however, his role as Jackie Robinson in film 42 was widely considered a breakthrough. He later played starring roles in other biographical films portraying James Brown in Get On Up and Thurgood Marshall in Marshall.


Boseman portrayed Black Panther, also known as King T'Challa, in four Marvel films. The first was Captain America: Civil War which preceded the aforementioned Black Panther film. Subsequently, he appeared in both Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.


Ryan Coogler, the director of Black Panther, wrote of Boseman, ""I noticed then that Chad was an anomaly"", recalling their first meeting. ""He was calm. Assured. Constantly studying. But also kind, comforting, had the warmest laugh in the world, and eyes that [saw] much beyond his years, but could still sparkle like a child seeing something for the first time.""


Actor Denzel Washington, who paid for Boseman to attend BADA, stated ""He was a gentle soul and a brilliant artist, who will stay with us for eternity through his iconic performances over his short yet illustrious career […] God bless Chadwick Boseman.""


Wayne A. I. Frederick, president of Howard University, wrote ""It is with profound sadness that we mourn the loss of alumnus Chadwick Boseman who passed away this evening. His incredible talent will forever be immortalized through his characters and through his own personal journey from student to superhero! Rest in Power, Chadwick!""


On Sunday, the MTV Video Music Awards also marked the passing of Boseman by dedicating the show to him. The audience was also shown a replay from the 2018 ceremony when Boseman gave his ""Best Hero"" award to James Shaw Jr. who disarmed a shooter at a restaurant in Tennessee.


During ABC's ""A Tribute For a King"", Sunday evening, a number of celebrities made appearances. Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Kevin Feige, Bob Iger, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Winston Duke, Mark Ruffalo, and Paul Rudd, all contributed. During the broadcast, Downey said of Boseman, ""He was having this immense success, in a strata of his own, humble hardworking, always smile on his face […] Black Panther was hands down the crowning achievement of the Marvel Universe. The one where people got to vote with ticket sales we require this. It is a fantastic movie that leveled the playing field.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Former_President_of_India_Pranab_Mukherjee_dies_aged_84,2020-09-03,Former President of India Pranab Mukherjee dies aged 84,"On Monday, Pranab Mukherjee, a career politician who served as President of India for five years, died. He was aged 84 years. His death was announced by his son Abhijit Mukherjee via Twitter. He died at the Army’s Research and Referral Hospital, in New Delhi. Mukherjee was cremated on Tuesday with full state honors as the nation began observing a seven day mourning period.


Born on December 11, 1935, in Mirati, Pranab Mukherjee began his political career in his ancestral home of West Bengal. He was brought into national politics and the Indian National Congress (INC) party by Indira Gandhi. Mukherjee was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper legislature, and was soon given ministerial posts by Gandhi. He became finance minister in 1982. Mukherjee was also elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower legislature, for two terms in addition to his five terms in Rajya Sabha. He served, at different times, as the leader of both legislative bodies. Mukherjee was elected President in 2012 and served his full five-year term, but did not seek reelection, citing age and health concerns.


Mukherjee was hospitalized on August 10 after a reported fall at his home. He was subsequently determined to have a blood clot for which he received brain surgery. The hospital also found him to be positive for the COVID-19 virus. While hospitalized, Mukherjee developed kidney problems as well as a lung infection which induced septic shock. It was reported he was in a coma at time of death.


Current Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi wrote, ""India grieves the passing away of Bharat Ratna Pranab Mukherjee. He has left an indelible mark on the development trajectory of our nation. A scholar par excellence, a towering statesman, he was admired across the political spectrum and by all sections of society [...] Condolences to his family, friends, admirers and supporters across India. Om Shanti.""


Vijay Goel, a member of the Rajya Sabha, said, ""He was an excellent politician, orator [...] For the Congress, he was the helmsman. He won [the] hearts of everyone. Our prime minister respected him so much, one can imagine, how important he was for the country. He was a true Bharat Ratna"".


His daughter, and member of the INC, Sharmistha Mukherjee wrote, ""Last year August 8 was one of the happiest days for me as my dad received Bharat Ratna. Exactly a year later on August 10 he fell critically ill. May God do whatever is best for him and give me strength to accept both joys and sorrows of life with equanimity. I sincerely thank all for their concerns"".

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Germany_says_Alexei_Navalny_poisoned_with_Novichok,2020-09-05,Germany says Alexei Navalny poisoned with Novichok,"On Wednesday, the German government said Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with Novichok, a range of neurotoxins developed by the Soviet Union. Last month, Alexei Navalny was airlifted from Omsk to Berlin because of falling ill, and transferred to a hospital in Berlin, Charité.


The German government announced the tests by a military laboratory found Novichok in Navalny's blood, and said there was ""unequivocal"" proof he had been poisoned. The spokesperson for the German government strongly condemned the attack. Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, demanded an explanation from Russia. The Russian government dismissed the claim from Berlin as groundless.


Navalny was airlifted from Omsk to Berlin in August when he was suffering from a serious medical condition.  Navalny is an outspoken critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin, and his associates had alleged Navalny was poisoned.  Initial reports from Omsk hospital reported no traces of poison were found in his blood or urine before he was airlifted by Berlin non-profit Cinema for Peace Foundation.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/On_the_campaign_trail_in_the_USA,_August_2020",2020-09-30,"On the campaign trail in the USA, August 2020","The following is the fourth edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.


This month's spotlight on the campaign trail: a bat attacks the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee, the American Independent Party picks a ticket amid controversy, and Birthers resurface to question the eligibility of the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee.


As the campaign shifted to August, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden led incumbent President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.4 percent to 42.0 percent.


After President Trump suggested in a late July tweet that mail-in voting could result in fraud, early August debate centered around the postal service. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Republican fundraiser Trump appointed to the post two months prior, instituted new policies at USPS that resulted in a slowed service.  Critics accused Trump of an intentional delay.  DeJoy maintained the USPS could handle the increased demand for mail-in ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Democrats in Congress pushed for extra funding to avoid potential voter disenfranchisement.  Trump endorsed blocking emergency relief as a means to prevent a proliferation of mail-in ballots.  Biden criticized Trump for this stance, arguing the President did not want the election to take place.  Trump repeated his claim mail-in voting would be fraudulent.  In addition, he initiated several lawsuits challenging certain states' mail-in voting procedures, particularly a Nevada law mandating ballots be mailed to all registered voters.


Biden named Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate.  Harris previously sought the Democratic presidential nomination but withdrew before the primaries.  This fulfilled Biden's earlier pledge to pick a woman as his running mate.  Trump questioned the selection.  He said the ""phony"" and ""nasty"" Harris attacked Biden during Democratic debates and blasted her behavior during the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearing. He also said Harris' poll numbers dropped precipitously before her withdrawal. Other critics outside the Democratic party raised questions about Harris' eligibility, which Trump also briefly entertained.  Commentators compared this response to the debunked Birther movement that questioned the citizenship of President Barack Obama.  One entity whose members challenged Obama's citizenship  and now do likewise with Harris, the American Independent Party, nominated a ticket of Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente for president and rapper Kanye West for vice president.  The party, which has ballot access in California, reportedly did not contact West about the nomination. West, a presidential candidate himself, with the Birthday Party, spent much of August seeking ballot access in various states. According to Forbes, West claimed to be in communication with Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner ""almost daily."" In mid-August, Kushner, on behalf of the White House, helped broker a deal establishing diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.


Just ahead of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Donald Trump's younger brother Robert died of an unspecified illness. Biden and Harris each sent their condolences to Trump.  Observers questioned whether coronavirus was the cause of death. The hashtag #WrongTrump went viral on Twitter shortly after, suggesting users wished for the President's death. The Democratic convention took place in a largely virtual format due to the coronavirus pandemic.  It featured speeches that were, for the most part, previously recorded.  Party business took place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Speakers hammered Trump for his response to coronavirus.   Biden was officially nominated with some delegates pledged to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who, unlike the other withdrawn Democratic candidates, did not release his delegates to Biden in order to help shape the party platform.  At 77, Biden became the oldest person ever nominated for president by either major party. Speakers throughout the four day convention included three former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Obama; former Ohio governor John Kasich, among other Republicans; and two brothers of George Floyd, whose death in police custody in May led to widespread protests.  Former First Lady Michelle Obama gave the keynote address on the opening night, urging viewers, ""we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it."" After her speech, the anti-transgender slur ""Big Mike"" trended on Twitter.  Harris, in her address, accepted the vice presidential nomination, becoming the first African American and first South Asian American to fill the role.  On the last day, Biden delivered his acceptance speech at Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware.  Broadcast of the speech appeared on a screen at a drive-in viewing nearby at Frawley Stadium.   Trump described the convention as a ""Hollywood-produced infomercial.""  He defended his record on the pandemic, and criticized Democrats for failing to mention Biden's opposition to Trump's ban on travel from China and Europe to slow the spread of coronavirus. In a later speech, Trump assailed the event as the ""darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history.""
Opinion polls did not show any meaningful convention bump for Biden.


Before the start of the 2020 Republican National Convention, the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin led to protests and unrest.  Blake survived the shooting but was left paralyzed.  Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers declared a state of emergency and deployed the national guard. Unrest continued in Portland, Oregon as well, where a Trump supporter was shot and killed. ""Law and order"" was a common theme at the convention.  Most speeches were given from Washington D.C., though the party handled its internal business, such as the unanimous renomination of Trump, in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, both gave speeches in Charlotte on the first day of the convention. Other speakers during the four day event included four of Trump's children; First Lady Melania Trump; Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who drew weapons on allegedly trespassing protesters at their St. Louis residence; and Nicholas Sandmann, a former high school student who received a settlement from CNN over the depiction of him during a 2019 anti-abortion march. From Israel, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke, defending Trump's America First foreign policy.  It was unusual for a sitting Secretary of State to speak to a political convention.  Democrats in Congress vowed to investigate whether Pompeo used State Department resources to engage in partisan activities. Vice President Pence gave a speech before a crowd of about 100 people in Baltimore, Maryland.  On the last night, Trump delivered a long acceptance speech on the South Lawn of the White House with 1,500 spectators and a large fireworks show afterwards.  During the speech Trump claimed, ""Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it is a surrender to the virus.""  Political commentators such as Brit Hume and Chris Wallace described the speech as ""flat"" and lacking energy.  Trump's decision to allow part of the convention to take place at the White House raised ethics questions as well. A Black Lives Matter group protested outside the White House on the last day of the convention.  A group of protesters surrounded and allegedly threatened Senator Rand Paul and his wife Kelley as they exited the event.  In reaction to the convention, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of ignoring ""truth, evidence, data and facts"" and said she would prefer Biden not participate in the presidential debates with Trump.  Biden rejected Pelosi's suggestion, saying he would act as a ""fact checker on the floor"" during the debate.


Unlike Biden, Trump seemingly received a slight bump from his convention. At the end of August, he erased some of Biden's lead in the nationwide RealClearPolitics head to head average, trailing 49.6 percent to 43.3 percent.


For  Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, the August campaign began on a hairy note.  According to the campaign, on the morning of August 1 around 4:30 or 5:30 a.m. EST, a flying creature collided with Jorgensen on the front porch of her South Carolina home.  That creature, a bat, apparently approached Jorgensen's neck and struck her on the chin. Wikinews contacted campaign manager Steve Dasbach and deputy campaign manager Jess Mears about the incident.  


""Jess Mears and I witnessed [the bat attack],"" said Dasbach to Wikinews. ""I was driving them to the airport to catch a flight to Pittsburg[h].""


Mears would not confirm Dasbach's account.  Instead, she pointed to a video of Jorgensen on Facebook, which corroborated most of Dasbach's telling.  Neither Dasbach nor Mears would provide Wikinews with an image of the wound.


On the campaign trail in Pittsburgh, Jorgensen stopped at a local medical facility. Jorgensen received five precautionary shots for rabies since the bat broke her skin.  Bats can carry the rabies virus, which is transmittable to humans and could result in death.  According to the CDC, treatment for any potential exposure requires a series of shots over a 14 day period. In her Facebook video, Jorgensen confirmed this course of treatment. 


""I'm taking the instructions very seriously"", said Jorgensen.  ""The instructions basically say if you miss any shots, if you don't take them on time, you die.  They didn't say it quite like that.  They said if you don't take the remaining shots on time then the shots you've taken will do you no good.  So that's kind of scary. [...] It is a bit disconcerting to have an encounter with a bat.""


News of the incident was not reported until after August 7 when Jorgensen tweeted about missing campaign events in Mississippi to get shots as part of her treatment.  Following the tweet, Newsweek, Politico, The Hill, Time Magazine,  Mediaite, The Independent,  and TMZ, among others, published stories on the incident.  A day after the news broke, the hashtag #LetHerSpeak, referring to Jorgensen's bid to be included in the Presidential Debates, trended on Twitter. 


At the time of the news reports, Jorgensen polled at three percent nationwide in the Change Research/CNBC poll.  She polled at two percent in the Monmouth poll.  This falls short of the 15 percent threshold for participation in the official debates put on by the Commission on Presidential Debates.


The American Independent Party (AIP), the same party that nominated the late Alabama Governor George Wallace for president in 1968 and future president Donald Trump in 2016, nominated a candidate with center left views for its 2020 presidential ticket.  At its August 15 convention with around 20 virtual attendees, the party nominated Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente for president and rapper Kanye West for vice president. The AIP, which has ballot access in California, the most populous US state, made the nomination amid three points of controversy:  De La Fuente's usual running mate, Darcy Richardson, was left off the ticket in favor of West; questions surround whether the AIP nominated the ticket to assist President Trump's re-election; and before the nomination, De La Fuente made several monetary transfers to the AIP vice chairman.


De La Fuente, a businessman who first ran for president in the 2016 Democratic primaries and was the Reform Party's 2016 presidential nominee, ran for president again this year; first as a challenger to President Trump in the Republican primaries, and then as the presidential nominee of the Alliance, Reform, and Natural Law parties.  For each of these parties, Richardson is De La Fuente's running mate.  The De La Fuente/Richardson ticket has ballot access in a total of 15 states.  But for California, with the AIP, West stands in Richardson's usual place.  Richardson had his own opinion on the matter.  He provided Wikinews with the text of a message he sent to AIP vice chairman Mark Seidenberg:
""Please let Rocky [De La  Fuente] know that if he runs with the unstable, bi-polar Trump-loving Kanye West in California that I will withdraw as his vice-presidential running mate nationally.
I've spent my entire adult life battling the duopoly and certainly DO NOT want my name associated with a candidacy that peripherally includes a Trump/GOP plant like the unhinged rapper .... [AIP co-founder] Bill Shearer must be rolling over in his grave.""


Richardson has since reconciled with De La Fuente and remains ""fully committed"" to the campaign despite its new association with West.  


West, who is running for president in multiple states, may not even be aware of the AIP nomination.   He has, previusly, not denied allegations his candidacy is meant to assist President Trump but also not admitted it outright.  The AIP is less discreet about its intentions. In comments at Ballot Access News, AIP chairman Markham Robinson, whose Twitter bio includes the hashtags #MAGA and #TRUMP2020, writes:
""It’s a long shot I’ll grant you, but our ticket may draw enough votes that would otherwise go to Biden-Harris to give Trump-Pence a plurality. 
Think about it for a second, who would votes for our ticket? Well, there will be those [who] vote for it based on their love and/or admiration for Rocky or Ye (Kanye West). There may well be Never Trumpers from the ranks of Republicans who will not vote for Trump, but are galled by [the] thought of voting for loathsome Progressives/Socialists like Biden-Harris. And there will be those who will vote for Rocky because of his Hispanic name and roots. In fact our ticket may turn out to be the most popular protest vote receptacle ever."" 


According to FEC records, De La Fuente's Rocky 101 LLC political action committee gave Seidenberg a total of US$10,000 over a series of five payments between December 2019 and April 2020.  The reports use the description ""research services"" or leave the label blank. Seidenberg defended the payments in comments on Ballot Access News and denied any allegation of quid pro quo:
""[T]he advance[s] received from Rocky [were] to cover hotels and travel expenses around California to run for House and/or Senate races. None [of the money] went to work on [the] race for President. [I] spent three days alone in March 2020 at UC Berkeley Law Library looking up Texas Election Law.  Most of the time was [spent] at the offices of the California Secretary of State and Registrar of Voters in Kings, Kern, Fresno, and Tulare Count[ies] on Rocky['s] run for House of Representatives."" 


When asked to clarify his association with Seidenberg and whether the payments influenced the AIP decision, De La Fuente gave a terse ""no.""  Robinson and Seidenberg were each contacted for this story as well but have not responded to inquiries as of this publication.

Prominent members of the aforementioned AIP, among others, question the citizenship and eligibility of Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Her selection as Joe Biden's running mate and ultimate nomination at the Democratic National Convention further highlighted these questions.  Political commentators see similarities to the questions posed about the citizenship and eligibility of President Barack Obama from those termed Birthers. Nearly all legal experts consider the perspective of Birthers as incorrect, arguing there is no question about Harris' eligibility.  Still, the vocal minority persists. ""Birther King"" Andy Martin, a lesser-known 2012 and 2016 presidential candidate, Wikinews interviewee, and former adjunct law professor, provided his own input on the Harris question.


At Ballot Access News, AIP vice chairman Mark Seidenberg commented:
""[Kamala Harris is] Constitutionally ineligible to serve as VPOTUS (Vice President of the United States). At [her] birth her parents were from foreign
countries and not US citizens, viz., she is not a natural born citizen. Then she [grew] up in her formative years in Canada and graduated from a high school in Canada."" 


Harris was born October 20, 1964 in Oakland, California to an Indian-born mother, the late Shyamala Gopalan, and a Jamaican-born father, Donald J. Harris.  The two parents were married before Harris' birth but divorced in 1971. Neither were U.S. citizens at the time of Harris' birth. Harris moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada with her mother and sister, Maya Harris, at the age of 12.  She graduated from Quebec's Westmount High School in 1981 before returning to the United States to attend college.


The 12th Amendment to the US Constitution makes the qualifications of vice president the same as the qualifications of president.  Article 2, Section 1 sets the citizenship qualification for president:
""No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President"".


Martin argues that since the term ""natural born Citizen"" is not defined in the document, the meaning of the term at the time of its writing should prevail.


""Under commonly understood legal theory in 1789,"" writes Martin, ""a natural born citizen had both parents born in the United States. Being born yourself in the US made you a 'citizen.' But you were 'natural born,' and therefore eligible to serve as president, only if both of your parents had also been born in the US.""


Martin says the founders constructed this ""significant barrier"" to ""prevent foreigners from coming to the US and procreating a baby who would then be eligible for the presidency.""  He claims the founders were concerned ""a German Prince would come to America and father a child to establish Germanic hegemony of the new nation.""


The 14th Amendment states: ""all persons born [...] in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens.""  Martin does not consider such birthright citizenship to have any effect on what constitutes natural born citizenship, seeing the two as distinct concepts.


Differing slightly in a Newsweek essay, Professor John C. Eastman of Chapman University School of Law writes that the term ""subject to"" in the 14th Amendment requires parents to be citizens subject to ""complete jurisdiction"" rather than mere ""partial jurisdiction"" as noncitizens.


AIP chairman Markham Robinson reflects this view in Ballot Access News comments:
""It is the AIP position that while foreign tourists (or illegal immigrants) are IN US jurisdiction, they are not UNDER it, so the children born in the US of such parents do not in fact enjoy 'birthright citizenship.'"" 


Eastman does not make a judgment on Harris, arguing that she needs to answer questions on the status of her parents at the time of her birth.  He holds that if they were ""lawful permanent residents"" at Harris' birth then she meets the requirement.  If they were only ""temporary visitors"" on student visas, she does not meet the requirement. 


For Martin, it does not make much of a difference.  While he believes Harris does not qualify as a natural born citizen under the 1789 view, he says court decisions made to challenge Obama's status have left the natural born citizen clause unenforceable.


""Harris can probably rest easy that despite the renewed debate"", Martin opines, ""she will not be blocked from taking the oath of office if she and Biden win.""


The majority of legal experts reject the views Seidenberg, Martin, Robinson and Eastman espouse. 


Professor Eugene Volokh of UCLA School of Law writes in a Newsweek essay that the term ""natural born citizen"" derived from the British ""natural born subjects"" which included all people born within the borders of the British empire.   Moreover, he says the 14th Amendment phrase ""subject to"" referred primarily to children born to Indian tribes.  He concludes Harris meets the natural born citizen requirement. 


Others dismissed the claims outright. Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean of UC Berkeley School of Law called it ""a truly silly argument."" Professor Jessica Levinson of Loyola Law School asked whether Oakland was part of the US and then declared ""that's the full legal analysis.""

As of Monday, De Zoysa was reportedly still in critical condition, after a bullet hit him in the neck. 


A man suspected to have supplied the gun to De Zoysa was arrested in Norfolk at 2am local time (0100 UTC) on Sunday.


Sergeant Ratana underwent open heart surgery at the centre and was then airlifted to hospital, but he was later pronounced dead.


Sergeant Ratana, from Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, served in the Auckland, New Zealand police force for five years. Reportedly the sergeant was due to retire in two months, and an acquaintance said he moved to the custody centre for its greater safety. 


The alleged shooter was at the centre after being detained earlier Friday in an area near Norbury, Pollards Hill, for possession of ammunition and Class-B drugs.

Officials said the Trumps' 14-year-old son Barron tested negative as did First Family and Senior Advisors Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.


Trump took to social media, posting at 12:54 am local time (0454 UTC) on Twitter, ""Tonight, [Melania] and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!"" Yesterday afternoon Marine One landed on the White House's South Lawn flying Trump to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) in Bethesda, Maryland.


Reports said both were showing ""mild symptoms"". Senior administration officials were tested as people were informed of the positive test. Senior advisor Hope Hicks had tested positive on Thursday. 


Presidential physician Sean Conley issued a statement saying Trump has been given zinc, vitamin D, Pepcid and a daily Aspirin. Conley also gave a single dose of the experimental polyclonal antibodies drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.


According to official statements, Trump, now operating from the WRNMMC, is to continue performing his duties as president during a 14-day quarantine. In the event of Trump becoming incapacitated, Vice President Mike Pence could take over the duties of president via the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution. The Pence family all tested negative as of yesterday and there were no changes regarding Pence's campaign events.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Guitarist_Eddie_Van_Halen_dies,_aged_65",2020-10-08,"Guitarist Eddie Van Halen dies, aged 65","Edward Lodewijk ""Eddie"" Van Halen, lead guitarist of US rock band Van Halen, died Tuesday at age 65 following an extended battle with throat cancer. His death was confirmed by his son, Wolfgang Van Halen.


Van Halen was a native of the Netherlands, eventually relocating to Pasadena, California.


Numerous iconic rock musicians such as Billy Idol and Yusuf/Cat Stevens paid tribute to the guitarist following the announcement of his death.


Eddie Van Halen was known for his heavy use of two-handed tapping and complex harmonics in his guitar playing, and has been widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists. The guitarist formed Van Halen with his brother Alex Van Halen in 1972. The band's 1978 self-titled debut album peaked at #19 on the Billboard charts and was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold over 10 million copies. The band eventually rose to become one of the best-selling musical artists to date.  In 2007 they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.


The guitarist is perhaps best-known for his guitar solo Eruption, the second track on the group's debut album. Mike McCready of Pearl Jam likened his first time hearing the solo to first hearing classical composer Mozart. In an interview with Rolling Stone, McCready commented, ""he gets sounds that aren't necessarily guitar sounds — a lot of harmonics, textures that happen just because of how he picks.""


Van Halen had been previously diagnosed with tongue cancer as early as 2000. He was known for his reclusive personality.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Second_US_Biden-Trump_debate_cancelled_amid_safety_controversy,2020-10-12,Second US Biden-Trump debate cancelled amid safety controversy,"The United States Commission on Presidential Debates announced on Friday the second presidential debate between US President Donald Trump and former US Vice President Joe Biden, which was slated for October 15, has been cancelled, citing COVID-19 safety concerns. 


In an official statement, the commission said, ""On October 8, CPD announced that for the health and safety of all involved, the second presidential debate, scheduled for October 15 in Miami, would be conducted virtually [...] Subsequently, the campaigns of the two candidates who qualified for participation in the debate made a series of statements concerning their respective positions regarding their willingness to participate in a virtual debate on October 15, and each now has announced alternate plans for that date. It is now apparent there will be no debate on October 15"".


President Trump tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, within just days after traveling to Cleveland, Ohio to participate in the first presidential debate against Democratic rival Joe Biden. The debate safety-recluations controversy followed.  Prior to the cancellation announcement, there was discussion the second debate could be held virtually in light of President Trump's recent COVID-19 diagnosis. The president called the notion a ""waste of time"". With the president's evident disinclination to a virtual debate, Biden scheduled a town hall in Pennsylvania for the day the debate was to be held.


The second debate was intended to be done in town-hall format. The Biden campaign criticized Trump's refusal to debate virtually, accusing the president of ""not want[ing] to face questions from the voters about his failures on COVID and the economy."" 


According to organizers, the final debate is still scheduled for October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and is to involve testing, mask requirements and social distancing. The debate is to be moderated by NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker.

Sunday, October 18, 2020 


The spread of coronavirus in late 2019 and then in 2020 led to a global pandemic, affecting various daily activities.  Originating in Wuhan, China, the virus spread globally, and by March, drastic measures were taken by the Indian government.  Some branches of the South Western Railway of India had started taking precautions by distributing masks to ticket collectors and guards from as early as March 8.  Some colleges were suspended by March 13, their exams postponed as the government introduced lockdown and enforced social distancing.


Announced in the evening, the Indian Prime Minister asked his countrymen to get the essential products and avoid going out as much as possible.  Long queues outside the grocery shops, people in masks, some in N-95 masks, and hand sanitisers at the gates of megamarts were a common sight.  There were reduced items in the shops, and some stores had a limit of the number of customers allowed in the store at any given time.  Food delivery services, and taxi services were on hiatus -- workers who depended on the profession  for their daily income, while people including software engineers were working from home.  Physical classes in schools and colleges were replaced by online lectures to prevent social gatherings.


While many relied on technology for continuing their work and earn their livelihood, Wikinews reached out to sex workers in Mysore in June who, unlike others, can't maintain social distancing for their work.  Two sex workers, Akram Pasha, and Jaya (a pseudonym), who were part of a sex worker's group called ""Ashodaya Samithi"" discussed how their lives had been affected by the coronavirus, the lockdown and the restrictions they had faced.


((Akram Pasha))  Greetings.  My name is Akram.  I am from Mysore.  I am part of a male sex worker community.  And I have been living with the HIV-virus for the last 18 years.  And I have been working with the Ashodaya [community] since day-one. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍नमस्ते।  मेरा नाम अकरम है।  मैं मैसूर से हूँ।  और मैं एक male sex worker community से belong करता हूँ।  और मैं पिछले १८ साल से HIV-virus के साथ जी रहा हूँ।  और मैं अशोदया [समिति] मैं day one से काम कर रहाँ हूँ।

((Akram Pasha))  Ashodaya is a CO — which is a Community Organisation — it works with female, male and transgender sex workers.  Its operations are related to their health: primarily, focused on HIV-AIDS. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍अशोदया जो एक CO है, जो community organisation कहलाता है, यह female, male and transgender sex worker[s] के साथ काम करता है।  जो उनके स्वास्थ को लेके, जो main होता है: HIV-AIDS को, उसको लेके काम करता है।

((WN))  So can you tell me something about yourself? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍तो मुझे आपके बारे में ज़रा बताएँगे?


((Akram Pasha))  About me?  I have been working as a sex worker in Mysore for the past 25-26 years.  And along with that, when Ashodaya was formed, I became a part of it.  Before that, my daily routine was to come [work] in the field, whatever was my task, complete it; and with the community — I would keep my distance — I didn't used to talk much with anyone in the beginning.  I would distance myself: come, [do my work], and then leave.  But when Ashodaya started, and I felt I am not alone, that there are many [people] like me in the community: we all have to move forward [in life] together.  With this thought, I started interacting with them.  So slowly-slowly: first sixteen people joined, then from sixteen; now there are about 5000 members in the community.  [It includes] female, male as well as transgender.  A lot of the members are gay, bisexual, homosexual, and hijrā[s]. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍मेरे बारे में?  में पिछले २५-२६ साल से मैसूर में मैं sex worker का काम कर रहा हूँ। और उसके साथ-साथ मैं, जो अशोदया शुरू हुआ, उसके साथ जुड़ा हूँ।  उसके पहले में, मेरा जो daily routine था, field में आना, मेरा काम: जितना है, उतना करना, और ज़्यादा community के साथ -- दूर रह -- ज़्यादा बात नहीं करता था में पहले किसी के साथ।  लेकिन -- दूर-दूर ही: आता और चले जाता था।  फिर जब अशोदया शुरू हुआ, जब हमें लगा हम अकेले नहीं हैं; हमारे जैसे बहुत सारे और community है, उनको भी हमें साथ लेके जाना है।  एसा सोच के हम उनसे साथ जुड़ने लगें।  तो धीरे-धीरे: पहले मैं: हम १६ लोग जुड़े.  १६ से अभी लगभग ५००० समुदाय के लोग हैं।  जो female, male and transgender।  जो इसमें ज़्यादातर हमारे जो बोलते हैं — gays, bisexual, homosexual, हिजड़ा — यह सब समुदाय के लोग हैं।

((WN))  What is your age? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपकी उमर  क्या है?


((Akram Pasha))  I am currently 45 years old. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍अभी मेरा ४५ years चल रहा है।

((WN))  You said you have been working for like what, last 25 years, [right]? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपने बताया कि आप पिछले कितने, २५ साल से काम कर रहे हैं?


((Akram Pasha))  [For the past] 30 years. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍३० साल से।

((Akram Pasha))  [I was] fifteen years old when we came here.  And then, slowly-slowly over time, I entered into this field.  But now, it is my time to retire.  Now I want to give others an opportunity. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍१५ साल की उमर थी जब से हम लोग यहाँ पे आए।  एकदम फिर धीरे-धीरे से इस field में आ गए।  तो अभी मेरा भी trading का time हो गया।  अभी मैं दूसरों को मौक़ा देना चाहता हूँ।

((WN))  [Would you] tell me about your work? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपके काम के बारे में बताएँगे?


((Akram Pasha))  Regarding Ashodaya? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍जो अशोदया के?

((WN))  Yes. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍हाँ।


((Akram Pasha))  Ashodaya mainly works to spread awareness [among sex workers] about HIV.  They gather the community, identify the needs of the community, look after what the community requires, and also deals with how the community faces violence.  I mean the, community often faces violence.  It happens from the family, from boyfriend, it can happen from their neighbours, their landlords.  So Ashodaya [fights against] violence and exploitation [against the sex workers].  Like for example, they advocate, they network [with the sex workers], and accrediting them by rapid enrolment.  They do all these [things].  And mostly about their health.  They spread awareness about HIV in the community, and they also counsel.  Their [sex worker's] job, which has a high risk [to contract STD], they [Ashodaya] help getting treatment of sexually transmitted disease[s] [sexually transmitted diseases].  Like for example, when we first speak to them [sex workers], we identify if they have any symptoms of STD, [and if so], we get them treated.  And then we go check for HIV.  And if they have contracted HIV, then we get [them] registered for ART [Anti-retroviral treatment], And we follow up after ART.  Those who are [HIV-]negative, we mostly encourage them to use condom[s], we explain them; and [we] tell them how they can live their lives in a better way. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍अशोदया mainly HIV-awareness के लिए काम करता है।  जो community को इक्ख़ा करना, community की need identify करना, community को main need क्या है, और community का violence किस तरीक़े से है: मतलब community में ज़्यादातर violence होता है।  Family से होता है, उनके boyfriend से होता है, और [उनके] neighbours से होता है, stakeholders से होता है।  तो ऐसी जो violence, मतलब उनके साथ जो हिंसा होती है, शोषणया होती है, उसके लिए कार करते हैं।  जैसे कि advocacy करना, networking करना, rapid enrollment करके उनको accredit कराना, यह करते हैं।  और उसके ज़्यादातर, स्वास्थ को लेके जो काम करते हैं, उनको HIV के बारे में awareness create करना, और councelling करना, और जो उनका काम है, उसमें जितना high-risk है, उसके लिए STDs का treatment करवाना।  जैसे कि, पहले हम उनको बात करते हि identify कर लेते है: उनको कोई STD का symptoms है, तो उसको treatment कराते है।  फिर बाद में जाके HIV का जाँच करवाते है।  अगर HIV हो गया, तो उनको ART [Anti-retroviral treatment] के लिए registration करते हैं, ART दिलाके follow-up करते हैं।  जो negative है, उनको condom के बारे में ज़्यादातर motivation करते है, उनको समझाते है, और उनके life में कैसे और अच्छी तरह से जी सकते है, उसके बारे में [बात] करते है।

And along with that, we are organising some programmes.  Now we are looking for places, the ways they [sex workers] can get a place [for their sex work].  We create awareness about it.  So these are [also] the things that we do.  And the other thing is, mainly, the social benefits for the community: There are some social benefits that the government provides.  For example, they get about 20 thousand to 50 thousand rupees from the Women and Child development.  So we also help them to get these [benefits].  Along with that: the national identity.  National identity is important for every sex worker.  When we started this organisation, almost 90% of the members [of the community] did not have any national identity.  For example ration card, PAN card, identity card, passport, or let it be any national identity: they didn't have it.  So we started from there.  Every sex worker should get a national identity.  Because that is very important for their nationality.  So thinking about it, what we did was to get everyone an Aadhaar card.  Our community got in touch with one of the Aadhaar [issuing] personal assistants, we asked them to get all of our people, almost 5700 people, the Aadhaar card.  We also helped the trans[gender] community to get it, so that there is no stigma there [about being transgender].  Whatever the [previous] problems were, of this community, trans-community shouldn't have to now face it.  So we thought that and got everyone [the aadhaar card].  So we got them the Aadhaar card, and also the Ration card.  There are three types of ration card: APL card [above poverty line], BPL card [below poverty line], and antadoya ann card.  [Our community] mostly has either BPL or antadoya ann card.  antadoya ann card is for the extrememly poor, or HIV positive people: they get some of the things for free.  There is BPL card [for others]. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍और उसके साथ-साथ हम लोग अभी नए programme कर रहे है, जो place को ले कर काम कर रहे है, जो place दिलाते है उनको।  Place के बारे में awareness create करते है।  तो यह सब हम लोग करवाते हैं।  और इसकी और दूसरी चीज़ है, mainly क्या है, जो community में जो social benefit: सरकार की ओर से बहुत सारी social benefit मिल रही है, जैसे कि उनको कुछ करने के लिए, WCD [Women and Child Development] Women and Children department है, कुछ पैसा मिलता है, २० हज़ार, ५० हज़ार, वो पैसे से वो कुछ कर सकते हैं।  तो वो भी हम दिलाते हैं।  और उसके साथ-साथ जो national identity है: हर sex worker के लिए जो main: important है, national identity।  क्योंकि जब हम संस्था शुरू किए थे, हमारी community के पास — लगभग 90 percent के लोगों के पास — कोई national identity नहीं था।  जैसे कि Ration card हो, PAN card हो, identity card हो, passport हो, या कोई भी national identity हो: नहीं था।  तो हम वहाँ से शुरू करें, हर एक sex worker के पास एक ना एक identity होना ज़रूरी है।  क्योंकि वो nationality के लिए बहुत important है।  तो ये सोच के हमने क्या किया, हर एक को आधार कार्ड करवाया।  जो आधार कार्ड का जो PA [Personal Assistent] था, हमारे संस्था ने रख के हम लोग को — लगभग हम लोग ५७०० लोगों को — आधार कार्ड दिलाया।  और उसके साथ-साथ हमने trans[gender] community को भी दिलाया, ताकि ऐसा नहीं है कि, वहाँ पे भी stigma हो।  जो community के लोगों को तक़लीफ हो रही है, trans-community को नहीं होनी [चाहिए], तो यह सोच के सभी को मिलाके दिलाया।  तो उसमें, एक आधार कार्ड दिलाया, दूसरा ration card।  Ration card में भी क्या होता है, APL card, BPL card, अन्‍त्‍योदय अन्‍न कार्ड: ये तीन कार्ड होते हैं।  तो इसमें हम like mainly दो कार्ड अन्‍त्‍योदय अन्‍न कार्ड और BPL कार्ड।  अन्‍त्‍योदय अन्‍न कार्ड जो होता है वह HIV-positive लोग, या कोई भी बहुत गरीब लोग रहते हैं, उनके लिए पूरा free में मिलता था, अभी तो BPL हो गया तो बस वो ही free मिलता है।  दूसरा BPL कार्ड।

In the third thing is, we approached some ministers for advocacy and to get everyone a voter ID.  So almost 60 to 70% of the community members got it.  We also helped some of the sex workers join other organisations for their vocational training for skill-building develop[ment], [...] like using a computer.  These are some of the other things that we did.  And then we work on different different kinds of projects.  For example, there was one about HIV-AIDS.  So we did that.  Then there was one about TIFR [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research].  TIFR focuses on reproductive health: It was about cervical cancer.  The different kinds of cancer that females can get, cervical cancer, breast cancer, uterine cancer: to detect that.  If it was in the first or the second stage, then get them treatment.  For those, who were in the third stage, we referred then in different hospitals.  Another thing was PrEP [Pre-exposure prophylaxis].  We got almost 800-1000 people PrEP: [we helped give it to] female, male and transgender community.  So that is a good improvement in their lives.  So they don't feel as if there is no one to look after them.  And to prevent them from contracting HIV.  So with this thought, we gave them PrEP and spread awareness about it. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍और तीसरा जो है, कुछ ministers के साथ advocacy किया, और सब को identity कार्ड, जो voter ID होता है, तो उसमें से लगभग ६०-७० percent लोगों को identity कार्ड दिलाया।  कुछ लोगों को दूसरे-दूसरे संस्था से जोड़ा, ताकि उनका vocational training, जैसे, skill-building develop[ment] के लिए जैसे [...] computer हो, उसको जोड़ के उनको काम कराया।  तो यह सब हम लोग करते हैं।  और mainly अलग-अलग project लेके काम करते हैं, जैसे कि, हम लोग को HIV-AIDS का programme दिलाया था, तो HIV-AIDS का काम किए, बाद में फिर TIFR का मिला।  TIFR का जो reproductive health के लिए काम करना था, जो cervical cancer को लेके, उसका काम किया।  जो cancer महिलाओं को, जो योनी cancer होता है, कोई और cancer होता है, chest cancer: breast cancer होता है या गर्भाशय में कैंसर होता है, उसके लिए identify करके, first stage या second stage में जो रहते है, उनको treatment करवाया।  जो third stage है, उनके लिए अलग-अलग होस्पितालों में refer किया।  और तीसरा जो है: perp का।  PrEP लगभग हम लोग ८०० से हज़ार लोगों को PrEP दिलवाया, जो हमारे community के लोग हैं: female, male and transgender community को।  ताकि उनके life में और अच्छा बदलाव आए।  ऐसा नहीं लगे कि हम लोग को देखने वाला [कोई] नहीं है: ये सोच के है उनकी ज़िंदगी में, HIV से रोक सके। HIV के साथ ना रहे; जुड़ जाए।  तो ये सोच के हम लोग उनको PrEP दिलाया और उसके बारे में awareness किया।

We are working on the COVID-19 that is going on now, spreading the information to everyone.  Telling them to maintain hygiene, to protect themselves from  COVID-19.  Because a lot of people have mentally changed from within.  So we explained them about COVID.  And we are also running our own corporative.  Like how there are railway cooperatives, KSRTC's cooperative, doctor union's cooperative: similarly we have our sex workers' organisations cooperative.  It is a public multi-purpose cooperative.  So sex workers collect money and save their money: and when needed, they take personal loan, gold loan, vehicle loan, housing loan: Now they focus mainly on giving health loan and education loan.  Because these two are very important for us.  This is what the community mostly needs.  Because they generally don't have money saved for [looking after their] health.  So for that they require loan.  Other than that they require loan for their children's admission [into schools], for education and even for their [children's] marriage.  So that is what we give importance to.  These are the things that we do. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍अभी जो COVID-19 चल रहा है उसके बारे में हम काम कर रहे हैं, जो information सबको फैला रहे हैं, कि hygene में रहना, COVID-19 से बच कर रहना हैं, पर अपने जीवन में कैसे अपने आप को, क्योंकि, बहुत सारे लोग, मानसिक — अंदर ही अंदर यह हो गए हैं — change हो गए हैं।  बहुत लोगों में बदलाव आ गया है।  तो यह सोच के हम लोग उनको यह समझाए: COVID के बारे में information दे रहे हैं।  और इसके साथ-साथ हम लोग cooperative चला रहे हैं।  जो अलग-अलग, जैसे कि, railway का cooperative होता है, KSRTC का cooperative होता है, doctor union का cooperative होता है: ऐसे ही हमारा sex worker organisation का एक cooperative चला रहे हैं: सार्वजनिक multi-purpose cooperative sector।  तो यहाँ पर sex worker: पूरे लोग अपना पैसा जमा करते हैं, saving करते हैं, और personal loan लेते हैं, gold loan लेते हैं, vehicle loan लेते हैं, housing loan लेते हैं, अब ज़्यादा focus health loan और education loan को देते हैं।  क्योंकि यह दो important है ज़रा हमारा।  Community को ज़्यादा need यही रहता है।  क्योंकि एक तो health के लिए वो अपना पैसा नहीं बचा के रहते, तो उसके लिए loan चाहिए।  दूसरा, अपने बच्चों के admission के लिए, पढ़ाई के लिए, या कुछ, शादी के लिए चाहिए, तो उसको हम importance देते हैं।  इतना काम हम कर रहे हैं।

((WN))  Sir, you said you helped around 5000 people get an Aadhaar card and a ration card.  5000 people across India, or just in Mysore? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍Sir, आपने यह बताया कि लगभग ५००० लोगों को अपने आधार कार्ड and ration card दिलवाया।  ५००० लोग पूरे भारत में, कि सिर्फ़ मैसूर में?


((Akram Pasha))  Across India.  No, not across India: Mysore, Mandya, Chikmagalur, Kodagu.  In four districts.  We [Ashodaya] operates in four districts. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍भारत में।  भारत में नहीं — पूरा — मैसूर, मांडया, चिकमगलूर, कोडगु।  चार district में।  हम चार district में काम करते हैं।  

((WN))  So, tell me, why did you choose to be a sex worker? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍तो आप बताइए, आपने sex worker का job क्यों चुना?


((Akram Pasha))  I didn't choose.  I worked as a massager in the beginning.  I used to think people come — get [services] for free — fulfils their desires for free.  Anyone who would come, they used to demand — ""I want this, I want that"" — they would demand everything for free.  Then I thought: ""Why should I [do this] for free every time[?]  After all, I am a human too.""  Yes, [until] it was a hobby, that was okay.  But now everything that they would demand: whenever [they'ld ask about] oral — they asked for oral sex, [they would] ask for anal sex.  Everyone had different-different demands.  So I thought: ""No.  I should not do it for free"".  In the sense, I should provide any service only in exchange of something: that is what I thought.  And with that thought, I chose this. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍चुना नहीं।  में starting में massager था।  मुझे लगा, हर एक आता है — मुफ़त में ले के जाए — मुफ़त में अपने शौक़ मिटा के जाता है।  कोई भी आता है, demand करता है — ""यह चाहिए, वो चाहिए"" — सब मुफ़त में demand करता है।  तो सोचा: ""क्यों इस को हम लोग मुफ़त में हर बार [करें], हम भी तो इंसान है।""  हाँ शौक़ था [तब] ठीक था।  लेकिन अभी, हर-एक चीज़ जो वो demand करते हैं: जब भी — oral के बारे में — oral sex पूछते हैं, anal sex पूछते हैं।  सब demand — अलग-अलग demand करते हैं।  तो हमने सोचा: ""नहीं।  ऐसा free में नहीं यह करना है, इसको हम लोग।""  मतलब कुछ लेके ही कुछ service provide करना है।  तो ऐसा सोच के जो हमने चुन लिया।

((Akram Pasha))  And at the time whenever we used to go work somewhere, nobody would hire me [as a worker].  For example, I used to go to a shop [to work]: Before that I had gone for work at many different places.  But over there, all I experienced was sexual harassment.  Nobody showed me even an iota of respect there.  And they also did not accept me.  Whenever I would go, they would then take me to their homes to clean the utensils.  No matter where I work: they would ask me for body massage.  Wherever I'd go, they would invite for sex.  All of these things made me wonder, ""We did not have a place there, why are we living in such conditions"", And thinking that I started this work [as a sex worker]. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍और उस समय, हम लोग कहीं काम [पे] जाते हैं, तो कोई हम लोग को काम नहीं देता था।  जैसे की कोई, दुकान पे जाते तो वहाँ पें हम लोग के साथ: पहले बहुत बार बहुत जगह काम के लिए गया भी था।  थोड़ा-बहुत दिन काम भी किया है।  लेकिन, वहाँ पे हम लोग को सिवाय sexual harrasment के सिवा कोई इज्ज़त नहीं मिलती है।  और ना तो वो हम लोग को स्वीकार करते हैं।  जब भी जाते हैं, घर में बर्तन धोने के लिए ले कर जाते थे।  कहीं काम पर जाते हैं, तो उनका body-मालिश के लिए बुलाते [हैं]।  कभी जाते हैं, sex के लिए आह्वान करते हैं।  तो यह सब हम लोग को लगा, ""ऐसे भी हम लोग को वहाँ जगह नहीं, क्यों नहीं हम लोग [...ऐसे] में जीते रहे"", एसा सोच के मैंने यह काम करना शुरू [किया]।""

((WN))  How was your life before becoming a sex worker? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आप sex worker के पहले आपकी ज़िंदगी कैसी थी?


((Akram Pasha))  It was ordinary!  I was childish.  I would play.  At that time: I was in the school too [like other kids].  I would also want to play [like other kids].  I would be with others, for a greater [amount of] time.  I used to do different-different types of jobs, like I worked in a factory, I worked in the vegetable market, I did a business of cloth.  Then I worked for someone who used to manufacture cement.  I worked at many places.  But at none of the places I would find it there:  the happiness that I now get with my community.  At the other places, I never found happiness. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍मामूली!  बचपना था।  खेलें-कूदें।  [त]ब हम लोग: मैं भी school भर रहा था।  मैं भी खेलना चाहता था।  सबके साथ रहता था ज़्यादा।  अलग-अलग काम करता था, जैसे कि factory में काम किया, सब्ज़ी मंडी में काम किया, कपड़े का व्यापार किया।  फिर बाद में जा के जो सूखी मिट्टी बनाता था [...] वहाँ पे काम किया।  सब जगह किया।  लेकिन कहाँ भी मुझे उतना यह नहीं मिला, जो अभी मैं अभी हमारे समुदाय के साथ मैं जितना ख़ुश हूँ।  वहाँ पे, मुझे ख़ुशी या, कोई भी मुझे यह नहीं मिला उतना।

((WN))  These day, I mean, when corona[virus] wasn't spreading, how was a normal day for you? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आज-कल, मतलब जब corona[virus] नहीं चल रहा था, तब आपके लिए एक normal day कैसा लगता था?


((Akram Pasha))  It was fantastic!  In the morning, how everyone gets up, goes to office, maintains their daily routine, have breakfast then go to office, have lunch there, and come back home in the evening: We also used to go in the morning and come back in the evening.  Since the time corona[virus] has been spreading: all of these activities have completely stalled.  If I think about corona[virus], I get goosebumps all over my body [: it causes chills down my spine].  Corona[virus] has caused just so much problems, it has adversely affected our entire community. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍एक-दम बढ़िया था!  सुबह, हर कोई जैसे कि उठता है, सुबह office जाता है, अपना daily routine कैसे maintain करता था, breakfast सुबह फिर office जाना, फिर lunch करना, फिर शाम को घर आना: ऐसे ही, हम भी सुबह जाते, और शाम को वापस घर आते हैं।  जब से corona[virus] शुरू हुआ है, तब से हमारी ज़िंदगी में तो एकदम [stall] हो गया है।  corona[virus] को ले के तो बहुत सारा, अगर याद किया, तो, मेरे बदन में कांटे आते हैं।  जैसे कि बहुत सारा problem हुआ है, coorna[virus] की वजह से।  हमारे समुदाय के ऊपर बहुत सारा असर पड़ा है।

((WN))  What are the things that you like about your job, and what [are the things] you do not like? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपको आपके काम के बारे में सबसे ज़्यादा क्या चीज़ पसंद है और क्या चीज़ बिलकुल [भी] नहीं पसंद हैं?


((Akram Pasha))  Mostly, I like solving other people's problems.  Whatever they may face, let it be, police harassment; or be it harassment from their family members at their home — So to go, stop those things, and bring them into their happy lives — I really like that.  And secondly, those people who are HIV-positive: they become closeted [and they distance themselves].  So to bring them new life, I meant, to bring them to their former lives [before contracting HIV], [to help them] to live like everyone else is living, to show them path to this life, I really like that.  Because I really like to bring changes in people['s lives]. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍ज़्यादा जो कुछ भी है, मुझे लोगों का जो problem होता है, उसको solve करना।  उनको कुछ भी, जैसे कि, police harrasment हो, या उनके घर में, family में उनके साथ harrasment चल रहा है, तो उसको जाके रोकना और, और उनकी ख़ुशहाल ज़िंदगी में उनको लाना, वो मुझे बहुत अच्छा लगता है।  और दूसरी चीज़ है, लोग स्वास्थ्य को ले के, जो HIV-positive हो जाता है, तो वो अपने-आप को जो, अलग तरीक़े से अपने-आप को बंद करना चाहता है।  तो उसको हम वापस नई ज़िंदगी लाना, मतलब उसको मामूली ज़िंदगी में लाना, सबकी तरह जैसे [...] लोग जैसे जी रहे हैं, ऐसे जीने के लिए रास्ता दिखाना, वो मुझे बहुत अच्छा लगता है।  क्योंकि लोगों का बदलाव लाना मुझे बहुत पसंद है।

((Akram Pasha))  But what I do not like is: The stigma people hold [against sex workers], when they discriminate, [...], [to divide] on the basis of caste and community, the way the judge people based on their clothes, or to show them a finger: these are the things I do not like. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍लेकिन मुझे जो अच्छा नहीं लगता है: जो लोगों stigma करते हैं, discrimination करते हैं, [...] जाट-पाट करते हैं, लोगों के कपड़े को देखके तोलते हैं, या उनका जीवन को लेकर तोलते हैं, या उन पर उंगली दिखाते हैं, तो ये मुझे बिलकुल पसंद नहीं है।

((WN))  Do you make enough that you can earn your daily bread? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍क्या आप इतना पैसा बना पाते है कि आप आपकी रोज़ी-रोटी कमा पाएँ?


((Akram Pasha))  There are no difficulties.  Whatever I make [from my earnings], I eat. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍कोई दिक़्क़त नहीं [है]।  जो कुछ भी मिलता है वो खा लेते हैं।

((WN))  So you are telling that for the last 18 years you have AIDS.  ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आप बता रहे थे कि आपको, कितने, पिछले १८ साल से AIDS है।


((Akram Pasha))  I didn't get AIDS.  I contracted HIV virus. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍AIDS नहीं हुआ।  HIV-virus हुआ।

((WN))  So were condoms not [readily] available at that time? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍तो उस ज़माने में condoms available नहीं होते थे क्या, sir?


((Akram Pasha))  Available: no, it was available, but we had the information that time.  We didn't see many clients.  We would engage with them differently, like for example, using hands.  And whatever it was, we didn't do sex [that time].  Because it took us 4-5 years just to come out of the fact [we've contracted HIV].  So when our organisation was formed, since then we have been getting condoms for free.  ((hi))Hindi language: ‍Available; नहीं, होते थे लेकिन उस समय ज़्यादा जानकारी तो थी हम लोगों को।  ज़्यादा client नहीं करते थे।  Client को कि अलग तरीक़े से, हाथ से करके आ जाते थे।  और दूसरा जो भी है, हम लोग वो नहीं करते थे: sex।  क्योंकि उस समय हमारा, status से आने में ही, हम लोग को ४-५ साल लग गए।  तो जब तक हमारा organisation आ गया था, जो अशोदया, उस समय हम लोग को कंडोम फ़्री में मिलना शुरू हो गया था।

((WN))  How did the last three months go for you? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपके लिए पिछले तीन महीने कैसे गए हैं?


((Akram Pasha))  Totally: totally [different].  I had never thought the situation would be so horrible.  I hadn't thought the iPod how to lock ourselves in our own homes. Or to isolate ourselves from others.  I have never thought that.  Because I have suffered a lot.  We had nothing to eat.  We are not rich, we han't saved any money.  What about we made in the day, we used to eat that.  What ever people gave, we ate that.  There are so many nights where we went to bed empty-stomach.  Our life was drastically different.  At that time nobody would even give us some money on loan.  ""How are these people going to return the loan"", they used to think.  Most of the shops were closed.  Any shop owner, whom we knew, was also closed.  Otherwise we would have asked them to lend [some groceries].  Whatever was available in 30 to 60 minutes we had to buy it.  So within that time we had together money and go buy: that was difficult to do.  And other thing was about health.  I had a lot of problems because of my health.  I am a diabetic patient, And I'm also have [high] blood pressure.  And on the top of that, I am living with HIV virus.  To live with all of these three: it's not easy!  Every month I require Rs.2000-Rs.2500 for my treatment: for my medicines.  To you have money for that was not easy.  I used to have medicines on alternate days: I mean, the medicine I took today, I wouldn't take it tomorrow.  If I had a surge, what will I do [if I run out of medicine]?  So I also had to embrace this reality. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍एकदम...एकदम [अलग]।  बहुत ही अलग तरीक़े से।  जैसे हम सोचे भी नहीं थे, इतना बुरा हाल आएगा।  मतलब हम लोग को अपने आपको अपने घरों में बंद रखना पड़ेगा।  या सब लोगों से दूर रहना पड़ेगा।  हम ये नहीं सोचें थे।  क्योंकि बहुत ही दिक्कतें झेली है।  जो हमारा खाना-पीना: मतलब हमारे लिए खाने को भी यह नहीं था।  क्योंकि हम लोग पैसे वाले नहीं है, तो हम लोग [ने] पैसा कमा के नहीं रखा था।  जो हम [पैसे] लाते थे [उससे] खा लेते थे।  [...]  जोजो और लोग दिये हैं वो खाए है।  और कितनी रात भूखे भी सोए हैं।  बहुत ही अलग तरीक़े से गुज़री है ज़िंदगी।  क्योंकि उस समय कोई भी हमें पैसा देने वाला भी पैसा नहीं देता था।  ""क्योंकि आगे ये कैसे पैसा वापस लौटाएँगे"", ये उनकी सोच थी।  और दूसरा जो था, पूरे दुकानदार बंद थे।  कोई भी हमारा पहचान का दुकान खुला नहीं था, ताकि हम लोग वहाँ पे जाके उधार लेकर खाएं।  और जो मिलता था, आधा-एक घंटे में हम लोग को ख़रीदना था।  तो आधा-एक घंटे में हम पैसे जोड़ कर के, जाके ख़रीदने में दिक़्क़त होती थी।  और दूसरी चीज़ है, स्वास्थ्य को लेकर, मतलब हमारा health को लेकर बहुत दिक़्क़त हुई थी।  जैसे कि, अभी में daibetic patient हूँ, और blood pressue का patient हूँ, और HIV virus के साथ जी रहा हूँ।  इन तीनों के साथ जी रहा हूँ तो आसान नहीं है यह!  हमारे लिए हर महीना लगभग दो से ढाई हज़ार रूपये treatment का चाहिए, दवाई के लिए चाहिए।  वो पैसा जुगाड़ करना भी दिक़्क़त था।  मैं एक दिन हाँ एक दिन ना लूँ।  मतलब आज जो गोली खाया, कल नहीं खाता था।  क्योंकी surge आइ तो कल कौन दिलाएगा?  परसों खाता था।  तो इस तरीक़े से उसके साथ भी समझौता करना पड़ा।

((Akram Pasha))  And the other thing was: No doctor in any government hospital was going to check us.  No matter what we suffered from, we had to endure it.  If my stomach was hurting, I had to bear it.  If I had a fever, I had to live with it. If I had a skin problem: same. You know, I had three rashes on my body.  For three months, I lived with those rashes which got a big infection.  No after three months I am finally getting it treated.  Because back then I did not have money to buy medicine, there was no doctor to show the problems.  Those people who used to know me and used to call me, they all have stopped.  Everyone is afraid of coronavirus.  If I call them up then they hang up the phone.  They don't talk to me.  These are the changes [I see in people]. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍और दूसरा जो है, कोई डॉक्टर, कोई डॉक्टर government hospital मैं हम लोग को देखने नहीं वाला था।  तो उस समय, हम लोग जितना भी तक़लीफ़ होता था, अंदर ही सेहता था।  जब पेट में दर्द हो, उसको भी सहन करो, fever हो, उसको भी सहन लो।  Skin-problem हो तो उसको भी ऐसे ही सब।  तुमको मालूम है, मेरे तीन rashes हो गए थे।  तीन महीने: मुझे तीन महीने उस rashes के साथ: इतना बड़ा infection हो गया था।  फिर तीन महीने के बाद अभी treatment करवा रहा हूँ। क्योंकि [...] पैसा नहीं था दवाई लेने के लिए; डॉक्टर नहीं था [...] दिखाने के लिए।  ये भी समस्या थी।  हर दूसरा जो था, जितने लोग हमें पहचानते थे, जितने लोग हम लोग को call करते थे, अभी पूरे लोग बंद कर दिए।  सब लोगों में डर आ गया, corona[virus] को लेके।  अब हम लोग बात करेंगे उनको तो phone काट देते हैं।  हमसे बात नहीं करते हैं।  यह सब बदलाव आ गया।

((WN))  What were the precautions that you took in the last three months, so you don't contract corona[virus]? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍पिछले तीन महीने में अपनी किस किस तरह के precaution लिए, कि आपको corona[virus] ना लग जाए?


((Akram Pasha))  I took my own precautions: for example, our organisation had told us what we should do.  And I also informed others how we should use masks.  And to sanitise our hands using a sanitiser.  Every hour, wash hands with soap.  If you had gone outdoors, use soap and bathe immediately.  And to maintain distance from everyone.  Like you should keep 2 m distance.  And if anyone was suffering from cough, cold or fever, So we would advise them about their health.  We will motivate them to go to hospital.  These are the things we did.  Whenever I used to go I would go wearing a mask.  I would use sanitiser often.  So to even buy a sanitiser do you know what I did?  I had to sell a ring that are used to wear on my finger to buy sanitiser.  It was a silver ring, I got Rs.200 selling it.  But using that I bought two sanitisers.  Health is important.  You have to do all of these things also for health. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍हम ख़ुद precaution लिए, जैसे कि, हमारे organisation ने हमें बताया था कैसे रहना है।  और हम लोग दूसरों को भी बताया, जो अपने-आप को कैसे mask [डाल] के रहना है।  Sanitiser से बार-बार हाथ wash करना है।  Soap से हर एक घंटे में हाथ धोना है।  कहीं बाहर जाके आएंगे तो, तो उसको साबुन के पानी में डाल के सीधे पानी-नहाना है।  और किसी के साथ ज़्यादा दूर से अंतर रखना है, जैसे दो मीटर [का] अंतर रखना है। [...] और कोई भी patient है जो सर्दी, झुकाम, बुखार: उसको जो health के लिए advise करना है, हॉस्पिटल जाने के लिए motivation करना है।  ये सब हम लोग करते थे।  हर कहीं भी जाते हैं तो mask डाल कर जाते हैं, sanitiser का इस्तेमाल बार-बार करते हैं।  तो sanitiser लेने के लिए भी, आपको बताऊँ मैं क्या किया?  हाथ का अंगूठी बेचकर मैंने sanitiser लिया घर के लिए।  वो चाँदी का था [...] 200 रुपये में गया।  लेकिन उतने में ही मैंने दो sanitiser ख़रीदा।  तो स्वास्थ्य ज़रूरी है।  इसके लिए यह भी करना पड़ता है।

((WN))  Did you receive the N95 mask or not? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपको N-९५ mask मिला कि नहीं मिला?


((Akram Pasha))  No no.  I didn't get.  We didn't get any mask: We didn't get anything for free. The mask we had, we made it out at homes.  And then there was another one which I got from the market.  It cost around Rs.30-Rs.40.  Certain medical shop they would sell a fire up your mask for Rs.30. So initially we bought that mask being Rs.30.  But then it got dirty.  So then I thought I'll just make it at home.  So we made it at our homes with her own hands and stiched it together.  I made it using a cloth and cotton.  I used that.  Every day I would clean it and use a different one the next day. And on the third day I used the one which I had cleaned.  So these are the things that I did for my own safety. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍नहीं नहीं।  नहीं मिला।  हम लोग को कोई mask: मुफ़्त का कुछ भी नहीं मिला हम लोग को।  जो mask था, वह हम लोग अपना घर में ही बनाया, और दूसरा जो था, एक बाज़ार में लिया था, ३०-४० का।  तो medical [दुकान] में, ३० रुपये का वो भी, और पाँच रुपये का mask ३० रुपये में बिकता था।  तो उस mask को हमने तीस-तीस रुपये देकर शुरू में लिया, फिर गंदा हो गया, फिर हमने सोचा घर में ही बनाएंगे।  तो घर में ही हमने उसको हाथों से सिलाई किया -- कपड़े का -- साफ़ कपड़े कॉटन का।  उसका इस्तेमाल करते हैं।  हर दिन उसको धोने डालते हैं और दूसरे दिन दूसरा इस्तेमाल करता है।  फिर तीसरे दिन धुला हुआ उसको डालते हैं।  तो इस तरीक़े से हमने अपने आप को safety किया।

((Akram Pasha))  Nobody gave N-95 mask, Or sanitiser or even a hand wash. The government give us a kit via WCD.  That was the only thing that we got.  It contained: 5 kg rice, 1 kg oil, 2 kg wheat, 1 KG pulses. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍N-९५ mask नहीं मिला, sanitiser नहीं मिला, दूसरा handwash के लिए कोई नहीं मिला।  जो kit था, जो सरकारी है वो WCD की तरफ़ से एक kit मिला।  जो सिर्फ़ एक ही वो: पाँच kg चावल, एक kg तेल, दो kg आटा, एक kg दाल दिया था।  तीन महीने में!  बस उतना ही मिला।

((WN))  You had financial difficulties all this time in the last three months? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍पूरे तीन महीने में आपको आर्थिक दिक़्क़तें रही?


((Akram Pasha))  A lot, yes  As I said, I can't even tell you how much problems we had faced.  Let it be getting the medicines or any other thing, It was extremely difficult to get that.  We didn't have enough money which caused the problems.  And then nobody would come to see me because I live far from others. They know about me.  But how are they going to come see me? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍बहुत बहुत।  बताया ना मैं, बोल ही नहीं सकते हैं, हमें बहुत दिक्कतें आयी।  दवाई लेने के से हर एक चीज़ से दिक़्क़त थी।  जो पैसा नहीं होने की वजह से दिक़्क़त थी।  और कोई भी हमारा, अपना ही नहीं आता कि देखता था, क्योंकि हम सबसे बहुत दूर रहते हैं।  मालूम है उनको हमारे बारे में।  तो कोई हमको आके कहाँ से देखेगा?

((WN))  Are you married? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍क्या आप शादीशुदा हैं?


((Akram Pasha))  No. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍नहीं।

((WN))  Did you get any financial help from anyone in your family in the last three months or not? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍क्या आपको आर्थिक सहायता आपके कोई भी परिवार वालों से मिली [या] नहीं मिली पिछले तीन महीने?


((Akram Pasha))  No.  Because my mum and dad do not accept me.  That is a different thing.  And I do not go to their place.  So whatever I get, I get from the community.  I live with my community. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍नहीं. क्योंकि मेरे mummy pappa मुझे स्वीकार नहीं करते हैं, वो अलग है।  और मैं उनके यहाँ नहीं जाता।  तो मेरा समुदाय जो भी है, हमें मिलता है हमारे समुदाय से।  हम अपने community के साथ रहते हैं।

((WN))  Did you try to find some work at any place in the last few days? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपने पिछले तीन महीनों में कहीं और पे काम ढूंढने की कोशिश की?


((Akram Pasha))  Yes I went to many households to wash that utensils, And I also did the cleaning work, and tried other things. They would keep me one day, Fire the next day.  ""Since you are an outsider, We are scared to be made contact corona [from you], so.""  Then I also went to do the gardening work for one or two days.  Or maintain the plants and trees.  They fired me from there too.  Saying, ""No no, we do not require [a gardener].  This is not an important thing right now for us.""  I have also tried distributing bonda, vada, but there was nobody who would buy to eat it. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍हाँ बहुत घरों में बर्तन धोने के लिए, और साफ़-सफ़ाई का काम भी किया है और कोशिश भी किया है।  एक दिन रखा, दूसरे दिन भेज दिया।  ""क्योंकि तुम बाहर से आते हो, हमें corona[virus] का दर है, इसलिए""।  फिर बाद में माली का काम करने के लिए गया है एक दो दिन।  जो पेड़-पौधे होते हैं उनको साफ़ करने के लिए, वहाँ पे भी भगा दिया।  ""नहीं, हमें नहीं चाहिए।  अभी हम लोग को [ये] करना ज़रूरी नहीं है"" बोलके।  और फिर, कुछ जैसे की बोंड़ा, वड़ा, उसको भी डालने का कोशिश किया: कोई खाने वाला ही नहीं था।

((WN))  When did you first hear about coronavirus? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपने corona[virus] वायरस के बारे में सबसे पहले कब सुना?


((Akram Pasha))  When [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi Announced a public curfew back in [March], That is when we got to know more about it.  I knew a bit about Corona[virus] are used to hear about it back in February.  But when curfew was in place then the fear started spreading.  ""Oh, corona is coming"".  And then when curfew started and the lockdown started, we learnt about [the coronavirus case in] Nanjangud.  Then we got to know more about corona[virus].  Me had a meeting the day before.  One 20th, we had a group meeting where we discussed what we should do, how we should do.  Then everything closed.  Since then, we never got to meet each other.  Not a single meeting took place.  It has been three-four months since then.  Since there neither we could go out properly not could we all come and sit together for discussion. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍जब २१ को [नरेंद्र] मोदी जी ने बंद कराया था, जनता कर्फ्यू करवाया था, तभी हमें ज़्यादातर पता चला।  कोरोना के बारे में मुझे, मैं थोड़ा बहुत सुनता था। फ़रवरी में।  लेकिन जब लॉक बंद करवाया, जब कर्फ्यू करवाया, जब भी हम लोग डर शुरू हो गया, ""ओह ये corona आ रहा है।""  फिर उसके बाद धीरे-धीरे से कर्फ्यू शुरू हो गया है, लॉक डाउन हो गया है, लॉकडाउन में नंजनगुड  के पास कोरोना के बारे में मालूम हुआ।  तो जब हमने को corona के बारे में ज़्यादा information और उसी समय हम लोग, पूरे मिल के बात किए उसके बारे में।  एक दिन पहले बात किए थे हम corona के बारे में।  जैसा 21 को कर्फ्यू हुआ था तो बीस को हमारा एक ग्रुप मीटिंग हुआ था।  ग्रुप मीटिंग में हम बात किए थे।  कि इसके लिए क्या करना है कैसे करना है लेके।  तो ये एकदम बंद हो गया।  आज तक हम लोग फिर नहीं मिले।  और एक मीटिंग नहीं हुआ।  तीन-चार महीने हो गए हैं हमारे।  अभी तक हमारा mobilisation या एक साथ बैठ के बात करना नहीं हुआ।

((WN))  So when did you realise corona[virus] is going to be extremely dreadful? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍तो आपके कब पता चला कि corona[virus] जो है वो काफ़ी भयानक होने वाला है?


((Akram Pasha))  [I had] realised during the time of the [initial] lockdown.  When the lockdown had started, [I] had figured out at that moment.  And a lot of people came from Italy, we used to see the news: people who were dying in Italy, [the] USA, China: so I had a lot of doubt at that time.  One was: both corona[virus] and HIV [to contract them] both: both were combined together and [was being] spread.  There were even more fears, and at that time, we had a lot of miscommunication.  That time, our fears were different, and we had thought [about this] very differently. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍Lockdown के समय में ही पता चला।  जब Lockdown हुआ, उसी समय पता चला।  और बहुत सारे लोग जो इटली से आया, जो न्यूज़ देखते थे हम लोग: इटली, USA, China में जो लोग मर रहे थे: तो उस समय बहुत सारा doubt था।  एक तो ये था: corona और HIV डोनो एक साथ है: जो दोनों को एक साथ मिलाकर बनाया, virus को, virus को छोड़ा जा रहा है।  तो और भी बहुत सारा डर हुआ, और उस समय में, हम लोग के दिमाग़ में बहुत सारा miscommunication था।  बहुत हि उसके बारे में अलग अलग डर, और सोच ही अलग थी हमारी।

((WN))  Did you not even get a chance to work as a sex worker during the lockdown? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍क्या आपको lockdown के समय में sex worker का काम करने का मौक़ा भी नहीं मिला?


((Akram Pasha))  No, I used to find some opportunities.  Clients in the neighbourhood would call me, But I couldn't go.  Because first of all there was no place to do it.  Secondly the police would hit us with the laathi.  We couldn't go outside.  They had completely sealed down this area.  We could hardly go out of our homes.  We could only go during the times the shops would be open, Buy the things from the shops, And even if we were a little bit late the police want to beat us.  We had all of those fears.  At that time, we were scared of the police beating us That we won't even remember [sex work]. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍नहीं मौक़ा तो मिलता था: आस-पड़ोस के लोग ऐसे client बुला रहे थे, लेकिन हम नहीं जा पाएँ।  क्योंकि एक तो जगह नहीं था, दूसरा, पुलिस वाले इतना डंडा मार रहे थे, बाहर निकाल के नहीं जा सकते थे। हमारे यहाँ पे तो sealdown कर दिया था पूरा।  तो हम लोग को घर के बाहर हिल भी नहीं सकते थे।  सिर्फ़ दुकान के समय में जाना और दुकान का सामान ख़रीद के लाना, और थोड़ा भी देर से हम आ रहे हैं, तो हम लोग को लाठी का मार पड़ता था।  तो ये डर था बहुत।  उस समय पुलिस की मार से बहुत दर था तो याद ही नहीं आएगा।

((WN))  You had mentioned there is a union of yours in Mysore. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपने बताया कि मैसूर में आप लोगों का एक union है।


((Akram Pasha))  No, it is not a union.  It is a body where we all have taken a membership collectively.  And we live together.  And, Whenever there is a problem, we raise our voices together, we fight it and we also find solutions to it. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍जी।  Union नहीं है, हमारा संविधान है।  इस संविधान में हम एक साथ मेंबरशिप लिए हैं, और एक साथ रहते हैं।  और कहीं भी हमारी कोई भी समस्या है, तो एक साथ आवाज़ उठाते हैं।  उसको लड़ते हैं।  और उसको: समस्या का परिहार भी ढूंढते हैं।

((WN))  For the COVID-19 problem, what did the community provide?  Any [information] on how to live? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍COVID-19 के लिए, [इस] समस्या ने: क्या समुदाय [ने] दिया?  कि किस तरह से आपको रहना है?


((Akram Pasha))  They couldn't give anything at all.  Because even their lives became a living nightmare, Even they couldn't get out of their homes.  Via our organisation we went out and spoke to some people including some donors.  And with that help we got some food for others.  And also for those who are HIV-positive, we delivered medicines to their homes.  We also distributed some calcium, Paracetamol, rantac, baralgan for a fever to the community.  Whenever they require it, they can use the medicines.  So we arranged for the food and medicines for the sex workers community.  We delivered them food and also provided them counselling to keep their self-confidence up. That entire self-confidence had vanished.  They were very frightened, lost, they had no jobs left.  Many were ready to commit suicide.  So we spoke to them and explained, and provided counselling, and tried to fulfil their needs.  This is what we did at the organisational level.  Most of the people couldn't go out.  Me and 8 to 10 people did some work voluntarily.  We went to the police station to request a permission, We got a pass. And using that pass, We were able to deliver medicines door to door.  And if someone required medical help, we would contact the doctor, tell them the symptoms on phone.  And the doctor would prescribe the medicines and send it via WhatsApp.  Using the same pass, we would go to a pharmacy, and get the prescription.  Because V did all of these things, the community didn't suffer as much [as otherwise it could have]. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍वो तो कुछ नहीं दे पाए, क्योंकि उनका जीवन ही बहुत ही नर्क हो गया था, जो वो भी घर से बाहर नहीं निकल रहे थे।  कुछ लोग से हमने, संस्था से जाके कुछ लोगों से बात किया, donor से बात किया, उनके ज़रिए उन लोगों को कुछ food दिलवाया, और उसके साथ साथ हमने जो भी [HIV-]positive होता है उसके लिए दवाई घर-घर जाके हमने पहुंचाया।  और दूसरा जो है उनके लिए calcium, और जो side-affect के किए जो होता है, fever के किए paracetamol, rantac, baralgan: medicine को हमने ले लिया और सभी community को थोड़ा-थोड़ा बाँटा।  उनको कोई भी समस्या हो तो थोड़ा बहुत इस्तेमाल कर सके।  तो ये food और medicine का बंदोबस्त करवाया।  और बाहर से खाना पहुँचाया।  और ज़्यादातर councelling की वजह से उनका आत्मविश्वास बढ़ता रहा है।  क्योंकि उनका आत्मविश्वास पूरा सो गया था।  तो उसने बहुत बहुत डरे हुए थे, बहके हुए थे, रोज़गार नहीं पा रहे थे।  बहुत लोग आत्महत्या करने के लिए तैयार हो गए थे।  तो उन लोगों को समझा समझा के councelling करके, उनकी क्या need है, उसको जाके कोशिश करते थे।  तो ये हमने संस्था की ओर से किया।  समिति के लोग कुछ कर नहीं पाए क्योंकि वो बाहर ही नहीं निकल पाते थे।  हम वहाँ पे काम कर रहे थे आठ-दस लोग, voluntary, बाहर police station में permission लिया pass बना लिया: फिर हम लोग जाके, पास के ज़रिए घर-घर जाके medicine distribute करना और उनको कोई समस्या है तो डॉक्टर से बात करके।  हमारे जो डॉक्टर था फ़ोन पे ही हम से बात करके medicine वो WhatsApp में भेजता था।  तो वो medicine को हम medical में लेके देते थे।  क्योंकि वो हमारे पास pass available था।  तो उसमें हमारे community के लोगों को ज़्यादा दिक़्क़त नहीं आयी।

((WN))  When did COVID-19 start to change your life? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍COVID-19 की वजह से आपके जीवन में कब्ज़े परिवर्तन शुरू हो गया था?


((Akram Pasha))  After February 18. After listening to [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi's address to the country, our life became a living hell.  That night, I remember, everybody was going, paying loads and loadsof buying groceries.  And we were left wondering what is going on!  How is this the reality?  If this is how it turns out.  And then as the time went by there was version one version to version three of the lockdown.  I am a Muslim. We could not go to the mosque to offer namaz for Eid.  Nor could we fast.  And we could not even celebrate the Eid.  This was an extremely bad day for us. We call it a black day.  All the days in the last three months of the lockdown they're just black days for us. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍February 18 के बाद से।  मोदी का जो भाषण था, भाषण ने ही हमारा नर्क़ की ज़िंदगी शुरू हो गई।  उस रात सभी जाके पैसे दे देकर लोग राशन ला रहे थे, हम सोच रहे थे कि ये सब क्या हो रहा है कैसे हो रहा है, कि सचमुच में ऐसा ही होगा कि नहीं।  फिर धीरे धीरे से v01, v02, v03 lockdown करके आया।  हम लोग मुसलमान हैं, हम लोग को ईद का नमाज़ पढ़ने के लिए मस्जिद जाना नहीं हुआ, या तो रोज़ा रखने हुआ, ना ईद मनाने हुआ।  ये सब हमारे लिए बहुत हि ख़राब दिन बोलते हैं हम लोग, black day, हमारे लिए पूरे ये तीन महीने lockdown के black day थे।  बहुत सारे लोग भी मर रहे थे, तो ये सब सोच सोच के, हमारे लिए ये day ही ख़राब निकलें।

((WN))  Did anyone outside the community: nany NGO or government helped you? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपको community के अलावा NGO या government से और कोई भी सहायता मिली?


((Akram Pasha))  No.  Nothing at all.  They just gave us some soap to keep ourselves clean.  THey gave us Detol.  Except for that, nobody even bothered to ask if we're alive or dead.  Nobody asked and nobody wants to.  They must be thinking we [sex workers] are a liability on this Earth, and we are better off extinct.  They left us to our sufferings.  Now also, I'm saying, you are the first person who reached out to us asking how we are, and what is going on, how you are feeling within.  You are the only one Who at least asked so that these problems get reported.  Except for you nobody was going to ask. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍नहीं।  ज़रा भी नहीं मिला।  हम लोगों को कुछ soap दे कर भेजें हुए हैं, साफ़ सुथरे रहने के लिए।  Detol soap भेजा है।  उसके अलावा कोई; कोई-कोई भी आज तक नहीं पूछा आप कैसे हैं, आप ज़िंदा है या आप मर गये हैं।  कोई नहीं पूछा और कुछ पूछना भी नहीं चाह रहा है।  वैसे ही सोचते हैं हम बोझ है धरती का, हम लोग ख़त्म हो जाए यह सोचा होगा, तो छोड़ दिया हमें हमारे हाल पे। अभी भी, मैं यही बोल रहा हूँ, आप पहले इंसान हो जो चार महीनों में बैठके तुम्हारा: तुम कैसे है, दिल में क्या हो रहा है पूछा, आप ही पहले इंसान हो।  जो हम लोग को at least पूछ रहे हैं, कि इसको बाहर ला सके।  तो ये बात: आप अकेले हों जो हमें पूछे, दूसरा कोई पूछने वाला भी नहीं था, या कोई बताने वाला भी नहीं था: ""ये सेवाएँ है, इनको ले लो""।

((Akram Pasha))  Whenever all the family is not with us, So how can we expect the world or even the community.  See, a human does not really need much:In their daily routine what they expect is food, a place to stay, and peace.  These are the three things.  And the other thing is, I'm not talking just about myself but the other members of our community as well.  Some have good families.  Almost 80% sex workers family do not accept them.  Whenever the family gets to know, [the sex worker] is kicked out of their home.  It is not even a question to go back to the family.  This is what happens.  So how do we expect the world to accept sex workers?  When we wanted money to distribute [medicines], the family would say, ""Why do you need it?  You have a lot of money that you have looted from other people, or made it unethically.""  That is what they say.  What we make is unethical [to them].  But what they do is ethical.  How so?  On what basis can you differenciate?  That would really make us angry, but we could not vent out the anger due to the lockdown. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍ख़ुद का family ही हमारे साथ नहीं था, तो समाज और संस्था कहाँ से आएगा?  देखो इंसान कुछ नहीं चाहता है: अपने daily routine में जो चाहिए एक तो खाना, रहना, और अच्छा सुकून चाहता है।  तो ये तीन है।  और दूसरा जो है, care करने वाले अपने ख़ुद के लोग ही हमसे दूर है, ये मैं अपने अकेले की बात नहीं कर रहा हूँ, जो हमारे बहुत सारे समुदाय के लोग है, उनकी बात कर रहा हूँ।  और कुछ लोगों की फ़ैमिली अच्छी है।  ८०% के family में कोई स्वीकरता नहीं मिलती है।  क्योंकि जब पता चल जाता है, तो हम लोग को घर से बाहर निकाला जाता है।  फिर वापस घर में रहना है तो दूर की बात, सोच भी नहीं सकते।  तो ऐसा होता है।  तो फिर समाज कहाँ से स्वीकार करेगा?  जब [दवाइयां] distribute बात करते थे, बोलते थे: ""तुमको क्या काम है?  तुमने जो लूटे हैं, लोगों से, कमाया है हराम का पैसा, बहुत सारा पैसा है आपके पास।""  ऐसा बोलते थे।  हम लोग कमाएं: हराम का पैसा, वो लोग कमाएं: अच्छा पैसा।  ऐसा कैसा?  पैसे में कैसे अंतर है?  ग़ुस्सा भी आ रहा था, लेकिन lockdown की वजह से ग़ुस्सा नहीं कर पाते थे।

((WN))  Have you resumed your work? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍क्या अभी आपने काम शुरू कर दिया है वापस?


((Akram Pasha))  No.  We have not resumed it now.  All of our work is suspended till August.  After August we plan on sanitising, and if we receive any form of relief, we should be able to continue.  Right now everybody is frightened.  So to avoid any further complications, we have halted everything.  No we just contact each other via cellphones.  Like for example to provide counselling or to get them any essential supply that they require, and if the doctor was available, they would discuss the problem with the doctor on the phone and ask for the treatment.  You will be diagnosed just by saying what was happening to you.  You couldn't go show your symptoms.  You are back in the day we used to fight: We did not want a doctor Who was not ready to touch or meet us in order to examine us.  But now, COVID[-19] Has made us desperate.  It has made so many people's lives miserable beyond belief.  It is like the thorn of a gum tree.  Whenever you pick yourself with that thorn, it secrets venom.  This is much worse than that.  I'm not just talking about my life, but everyone's life.  Poor, old-aged people: Everyone's lives are not in a bad condition.  But for us sex workers, it is in a different way. Our lifestyle has been completely disrupted.  It is snatched away all of our happiness. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍नहीं।  अभी भी आज तक हमने काम नहीं किया है।  August तक भी हमने अपना operation close किया है।  August के बाद हम उसको sanitise करके अगर relief मिलेगा तो शुरू करेंगे।  क्योंकि अभी भी डर है।  तो कहीं दिक़्क़त न हो इसके लिए हमने बंद किया है।  अभी हम सिर्फ़ फ़ोनों में contact करते हैं।  जैसे कि, councelling करना, उनको जो चीज़ चाहिए, वो दिलाना, अगर doctor available है, जो भी कोई दिक़्क़त है तो phone में ही contact करके treamment लेते हैं।  सिर्फ़ diagnose बोल के लेना पड़ता है, दिखा के नहीं लेना पड़ता।  कभी कभी यही fight हम कर रहे थे, की कोई doctor हमें छूता नहीं, देखता नहीं, ऐसा doctor हमें नहीं चाहिए, ऐसा बोलते थे।  लेकिन COVID ने हम लोग को मजबूर कर दिया है।  COVID बहुत लोगों की ज़िंदगी नर्क बना दिया।  ये कीकर का काँटा है ये: काँटा चुभता है ना तो अंदर ज़हर फैल जाता है।  कीकर के काँटे से भी भयंकर चीज़ है ये।  हम अपनी life के बारे में नहीं बोल रहे, हर एक की life में: हरेक ग़रीब, बुद्धे, बुजुर्ग: सबकी ज़िंदगी में भी यह बहुत ख़राब हाल है, लेकिन हमारे लिए अलग तरीक़े का है।  हमारा lifestyle सब बंद हो गया।  हमारी ख़ुशियाँ ही छीन ली।

((WN))  Before COVID-19, could you easily avail any medical help that you needed? Or were there any hurdles? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍COVID के पहले जो आपको medical help, जो आपको सहायता चाहिए रहती थी, क्या आपको वो आसानी से मिल पाती थी?  या आपको कोई दिक़्क़त आती थी?


((Akram Pasha))  Where? In hospitals? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍कहाँ पे? हॉस्पिटलों में?

((WN))  Yes. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍हाँ।


((Akram Pasha))  No, we were not allowed to enter the hospitals.  There was only one ART centre.  We would just go there.  We had to cover our mouths, hands, and legs.  They had allocated numbers.  Using that number, one would go get the medicines and come back.  We Will get on the 2 to 3 minutes there.  There was no OPD centre.  There was no consultation doctor.  There was no admission.  They had shut the gate. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍नहीं हॉस्पिटल में तो हमें entry हि नहीं था ना।  फिर एक ही ART centre एक ही था।  वो भी किया था, हम लोग को मुँह ढक के, हाथ ढक के, पैर ढक के जाना हैं, और हम लोग को सिर्फ़ नम्बर बोल के, दवाई ले कर वापस आ जाना है।  सिर्फ़ 2-3 मिनट ही हम लोग को वहाँ पे रहने का मौक़ा मिलता था।  क्योंकि कोई OPD सेंटर नहीं था।  कोई consultation doctor नहीं था।  या कोई admission नहीं था।  मतलब बाहर से ही gate बंद कर दिया था।

((WN))  Was this before COIVD, or during? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍ये COVID के पहले था, कि दौरान?


((Akram Pasha))  No not in the beginning.  During COVID.  Before that, there were all the services.  Things were at place due to the work our organisation had done.  When we previously used to go, we would get the facilities. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍पहले, पहले नहीं: COVID में। COVID ये पहले सभी service था, OPD था, एक referral system सिस्टम था।  क्योंकि हमने धीरे-धीरे एक जगह बनायी थी, जहाँ हमारा organisation था, हम लोग जो भी जाते हैं उनको पहले ही मिलता था।

((WN))  Apart from this, have you faced any problems in the last three to four months? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍अपनी इसके अलावा पिछले तीन-चार महीने में कोई भी दिक़्क़त झेली जिसके बारे में आप बताना चाहेंगे?


((Akram Pasha))  So what do I even tell you, we've had so many problems.  Like for example, some sex workers are from other places.  They have left their famikidelies there and have come here.  No they cannot go back and see their kids and their family.  Some are from Agra, some from Kerala, and these people can't go back to their familes.  This is a big problem.  They cry, saying, ""What is this, What can we do? I can't even go back to see my family.""  And the other problem is nobody has their own homes.  The rent of the last three months has aggregated to be more than the deposit sex workers paid to the landlord.  Most of the landlords have said to vacate the place, or to pay the rent.  Nobody is ready to lend us some money, So how do we take some loan to pay the rent?  So many people have vacated their places and mooved with their friends.  Some people tried to pay off the rent by selling the things they owned.  And some people are now homeless.  And the money we had borrowed that we took, the loanee charged double-double interest and now, and now stands on our chest, ""Are you going to return the money or not?"".  He will fight in front of our homes.  So we are facing so many problems related to our home.  Now we fear, when the loanee will come and argue, and humiliate us in front of the neighbours.  When he would argue, he would intentionally say, ""you aren't that good: you do this [sex work], you do that"".  And when the neighbours too, get to know, [we are sex workers], then we would have to vacate the place.  That is another concern. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍Sir, मैं क्या बताऊँ आपको, बहुत सारी दिक्कतें जैसे कि कुछ सारे sex worker अपने गाँव से दूर रहते हैं।  जैसे की अलग अलग दूर से भी आ के यहाँ बसे हैं।  वहाँ पे अपने बच्चों को छोड़ के आया है।  तो उनको देख नहीं है उनके पास जाने के लिए उनको नहीं हो रहा है।  कुछ लोग आगरा से या कही केरल से आ के बसे हैं, तो उनको वापस जाके, अपनी फ़ैमिली और बच्चों को मिलने के लिए नहीं हो रहा है।  तो ये भी बहुत बढ़ी दिक़्क़त है।  वो लोग इतना रोते हैं, ""ये कैसा है, हम लोग क्या करें, हम लोग से उनको वापस जाकर देख सके, ऐसा भी नहीं हो रहा है""।  तो वो भी एक दिक़्क़त है।  और दूसरी दिक़्क़त है: ज़्यादातर किसी के पास भी मकान नहीं है।  मकान के लिए जो डिपॉज़िट भरा था, तीन महीने में उससे ज़्यादा मकान मालिक का किराया हो गया।  बहुत सारे मकान मालिक ने उनको घर ख़ाली करने बोला है, या तो किराया देने के लिए बोला है।  और कोई भी कर्ज़दार कर्ज़ देने के लिए तैयार नहीं हैं।  तो कर्ज़ ले के मकान मालिक को कहाँ से देंगे?  तो इसके लिए कई लोग अपना घर ख़ाली करने के अपने दोस्त के यहाँ रह रहे है।  कुछ लोग अपना घर का सामान बेच के।  कुछ लोग रस्ते पे आ गए हैं।  और सूत के लिए हम कर्ज़ लिए थे, वो double-double interest डाल दिया, और अभी इतना छाती पे बैठा है, ""आप पैसा दोगे या नहीं?"" करके घर के पास झगड़ा करेंगे।  तो घर के मारे ये सारी समस्या हो गई है।  डर पैदा हो गया, कब कर्ज़दार आएगा, कब झगड़ा करेगा, कब आजू-बाज़ू हमारी इज़्ज़त चली जाएगी।  जब झगड़ा कर रहा है, जानबूझ के बताएगा ""तुम कौनसा अच्छे हो: तुम ये करते हो, वो करते हो""।  पड़ोसियों को भी और पता चल जाएगा, तो फिर वहाँ से भी हमें घर ख़ाली कराया जाएगा, वो भी डर है।

((WN))  In your last three-four months, your income was reduced or stopped: how did you deal with this reality? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपके जो पिछले तीन-चार महीने में ही आमदनी कम या बंद ही हो गयी: इस सच्चाई के साथ कैसे समझौता किया?


((Akram Pasha))  I had to come to terms with.  Because there was no other way. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍समझौता तो करना पड़ा, क्योंकि और कोई चारा नहीं था ना।

((WN))  Has a situation like this — like what happened during COVID — has that ever [happened to you?] ((hi))Hindi language: ‍क्या ऐसा आपके साथ — जैसा COVID के साथ जो हाल हुआ है — पहले कभी भी इस तरह का [हाल हुआ है?]


((Akram Pasha))  No, never in my life this has happened before.  Yes maybe during my childhood, when there was a feud between Hindu-Muslims, so for a few days this is how the situation was due to the curfew.  But that was not even comparable: It was not this long, It wasn't this big.  [The country] wasn't closed like this.  It is a very different time.  We will remember it our entire lives.  Even our kids are going to remember this their whole lives. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍नहीं, life मैं कभी ऐसा नहीं हुआ।  शायद हमारे बचपन में, जब हिन्दू-मुस्लिम का जो घोटाला हुआ था, कुछ दिन curfew की वजह से, ये हालत थी।  कुछ दिन के लिए। लेकिन इतना long और इतना bada नहीं था।  ऐसा बंद नहीं था।  ये समय जो था ना, बहुत ही अलग था, ज़िंदगी भर याद रखेगा।  हमारे बच्चे ज़िंदगी भर याद रखने वाले हैं, ये COVID को।

((WN))  What do you do when flu is spreading in Mysore?  does your work hault for that time?  Or do you take a different kind of caution? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍जब मैसूर में फ्लू चलता है ना, उस टाइम आप क्या करते हैं?  आपका काम उस टाइम बंद हो जाता है?  की आप कोई अलग तरह की सावधानी [लेते हैं]?


((Akram Pasha))  No we do it differently, Taking precautions.  When there was H1N1 outbreak, there was the bird flu, and then malaria, What are used to do is use different methods.  When they needed some advice, we would put together the information on a paper, and send it to them.  During the time of H1N1, we didn't go, I would send them in ambulance, and get the information how their treatment was going on or what medicine they needed.  We did the same thing during COVID.  Pick up the precautions and did not meet in groups.  We didn't go to other peoples home and spend time there without any purpose.  We will just speak on phone.  When we used to deliver the medicines we would wear gloves, masks, full t-shirts and also cover our heads for that.. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍नहीं, अलग तरीक़े से, अपना precaution लेके।  जैसे कि पिछले H1N1, और जो bird flu हुआ, उसके बाद मलेरिया: उसको हम क्या करते थे, हम उसमें अलग तरीक़े से करते हैं।  ज़्यादा पास जाके नहीं, दूर: जैसे की उनको अगर कोई सलाह चाहिए, उसके लिए कुछ paper करते हैं, information डालते हैं, उन तक पहुँच जाते हैं।  जैसे कि H1N1, हम लोग ख़ुद ही नहीं जाते हैं, ambulance को भेज कर उनका जानकारी लेते हैं।  उनका कैसा है, उनका treatment कैसा चल रहा है, कौनसा medicine चाहिए।  COVID मैं भी हमने ऐसा ही किया।  precaution लिया और ग्रुप नहीं किया, कभी किसी के घर पे जा के time waste नहीं किए।  बस ऐसे ही phone पे ""hi hello"" बात किए।  जब medicine देने जाते थे, [...], तो gloves, mask full t-shirt, सिर पे टोपी, यह सब बाँध के ही जाते थे।

((WN))  Would you say: When H1N1 [swine flu] was spreading — which was happening in 2009 — was it much better in than now during Corona? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍H1N1 का जो समय चल रहा था, २००९ में चल रहा था, वो corona[virus] के मालमे में काफी बेहतर था, आप ये बोलेंगे?


((Akram Pasha))  That was much better.  At least it did not spread in Mysore.  But I heard the problems that were happening in Africa.  But it was not that frightening.  We were not nearly as afraid as we are, right now during corona[virus outbreak].  But [coronavirus] is worse than the probelm of untouchability. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍बहुत बेहतर था।  At least, मैसूर में नहीं फैला, लेकिन सुना था जो अफ़्रीका में क्या problem हुआ, लेकिन फिर भी उतना डर नहीं था।  corona[virus] जितना डर उस समय नहीं था।  लेकिन ये बीमारी छूत छात से भी ज़्यादा है।

((WN))  What do you think will happen to your work after corona[virus] pandemic is over? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपको क्या लगता है, कि corona[virus] के जाने के बाद, आपके काम में क्या बर्ताव आएगा?


((Akram Pasha))  I don't even know if work will be possible or not, Or if it will be just like how it was before.  I don't even know, The awareness that we spread among the community, If they still remember it or not.  I don't know if the community is going to accept  us or not. These are the questions.  In their minds, they feel ""What is going to happen, let it happen.  We will see.""  We know everyone wants to make money, But we don't know if our work is going to function correctly or not.  I think it is going to be difficult to gather the entire community now. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍पता नहीं काम होगा भी या नहीं, पहले जैसा, मालूम नहीं।  और दूसरा जो है, corona[virus] की वजह से उनके मन में जो awareness लाए थे, वो awareness है भी नहीं।  community के लोग हमको फिर से स्वीकार करेंगे भी या नहीं, ये सब सवाल है।  उनके मन में, ""जो होगा सो होज़, देखा जाएगा"": ये हो गया है।  अभी हर किसी को पैसा कमाना है, हमारा काम ठीक से चलेगा ये नहीं बोल सकते हैं।  क्योंकि आगे जाके हम लोग पूरे लोगों को इकट्ठा करना बहुत मुश्किल होगा।

((WN))  Until when do you plan to continue working as a sex worker? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आप sex worker का काम और कितने time करना चाहेंगे?


((Akram Pasha))  I do it till the time I can.  Because apart from this, I do not have any alternate job.  We do not have any other V to on our livelihood if we leave this.  We do not know how to do business, nor do I have my need to start my own [business]. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍जब तक चलेगा तब तक, क्योंकि इसके अलावा हमारे पास और कोई भी alternate ना तो काम है।  अभी ये छोड़ें तो हमारे पास दूसरा कोई रास्ता भी नहीं है।  हम लोग को कोई व्यापार नहीं आता है, या कोई पैसा नहीं है, ताकि business करने के लिए।

((WN))  During your work — as a sex worker — what are the things that you have learned in your life? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपने आपके काम के दौरान, as a sex worker, आपने क्याimportant चीज़े ज़िंदगी में सीखी है?


((Akram Pasha))  This is the wonderful question that you have asked, I really liked it.  So what is the most important for me, it is: Not to cause any discomfort, or suffering to others.  I never did that.  Whenever anybody would come, I will always satisfy them.  And the other thing is, I would always hope, Nobody else contracts [HIV] because of me.  And what I did, Unlike them other people who are not honest, I was always never corrupt.  I never ever stole or snatched away someone's money.  Apart from that I also give importance to my own health.  So until the time I am healthy, I will have a good life.  So I give importance to my own health. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍एक तो बहुत बढ़िया आपका सवाल ये जो है, बहुत अच्छा लगा: क्योंकि मैंने ज़्यादातर important क्या है: किसी को भी दुख देना, या दूसरों को तक़लीफ़ देना, ये मैंने नहीं किया है।  जब भी लोग आते थे, उनको ख़ुश करके भेजता था।  और दूसरा जो है, मैं कभी भी यह सोचता था, मेरी वजह से किसी को infection ना हो, मेरे से कोई तक़लीफ़ न हो।  और मैंने क्या किया: जैसे दूसरों का — जैसे कि कुछ लोग इसमें ईमानदारी नहीं होती है — कभी भी मैंने ईमानदारी से ही किया।  कभी किसी के साथ उनका पैसा चुरा लेना, छीन लेना: ये मैंने नहीं किया।  उसके अलावा और मैंने अपने स्वास्थ्य को importance दिया, ताकि जब तब मैं अच्छा रहूँगा, तब तक मैं अपने life मैं अपने आपको और अपना health को अच्छा रखूँगा, तो जी पयूँगा।  तो इसके लिए मैंने अपने health को importance दिया।

((WN))  As you had said the only thing you got from the government was that kit, nothing other than that: What are the things the government should have done differently so your situation would not have been so bad? ((hi))Hindi language: ‍जैसे आपने बताया कि इस बार government से इतना कुछ नहीं मिला, वो kit के अलावा और कुछ नहीं मिला: government को क्या-क्या चीज़ें अलग-अलग तरीक़े से करनी चाहिए थी, कि आप लोगों की हालत इतनी ख़राब न हो?


((Akram Pasha))  If this is how the reality is, So before declaring the lockdown they should have generated some sort of scheme.  We are not alone, I'm not just speaking about myself, and not just about the community, but those who are poor, who are dalit, those who are beggras: They should have done something for these people as well.  Now they are announcing plans for crores of rupees -- What is that for us in that?  There is nothing allocated for people like us in that.  Before taking these steps they should have thought about us.  Now they are providing the suicide ration.  They're are distributing 10 kg rice.  What should we do of that rice?  Dissolv it in water and drink it?  Can we even cook that rice?  That rice is of such a terrible quality.  What do I even say about that?  Should have thought of some other options so that others could survive too.  That others could do something too.  There are so many migrants, So they should have made sure the migrants could reach travel back to their places before implementing a lockdown.  They didn't think all of these things, they thought lockdown was the only remedy.  This was not right.  They should have thought a little bit, Taken someone's opinion.  Not necessarily just from India, Maybe they could have asked someone from outside: There are many.  But they didn't think about it then, And they are not thinking now. They did not think about us. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍पहले इस चीज़ को, अगर ऐसा हो रहा है, तो lockdown करने से पहले कुछ scheme जारी करना था।  हम लोग अकेले नहीं हैं, मैं अपनी ही बात नहीं कर रहा हूँ, जो अपने community के हैं, उनके साथ जो जो ग़रीब है, दलित है, और कुछ भिखारी हैं: सभी लोग हैं इसमें, तो कुछ न कुछ तो इसके लिए।  अभी वो इतने करोड़ रुपये का यह जारी किया है, उसमें हमारे लिए क्या है?  एक रुपये का भी हमारे लिए उसमें पैसा नहीं है।  तो ऐसा करने के पहले इनको हमारे बारे में कुछ न कुछ हमारे बारे में सोचते।  अभी बोल रहे हैं की राशन दे रहे हैं society में, हर एक को १० kg चावल।  चावल को लाके क्या करना है? पानी में घोल के क्या, पी जाना है?  और वो चावल को भी क्या पका सकते हैं?  इतने गंदे चावल रहते हैं society के।  इसके अलावा मैं क्या बताऊँ?  सरकार को कुछ ऐसा option सोचना था, ताकि सभी भी जी सके, सभी भी कुछ कर सके।  जो कुछ लोग migrant है, तो वो migrant वापस अपने घर तक पहुँच जाए, वो करके ही करना था।  उन्होंने कुछ भी सोचा नहीं, बस एक lockdown ही उसका दावा है, सोच के उन्होंने lockdown कर दिया।  तो ठीक नहीं है।  पहले थोड़ा-बहुत सोचना था, या किसी से राय लेना था।  सिर्फ़ अकेले नहीं हैं, जो हमारे भारत देश में, बहुत सारे-एक है।  लेकिन अभी भी नहीं सोचा।  तभी भी नहीं सोचा, अभी भी नहीं सोचा।  हमारे बारे में कुछ नहीं सोचा।

((WN))  These were all the questions I had for you, Akram. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍जी अकरम जी, मेरे पास आपके लिए इतने ही सवाल थे।


((WN))  Thank you for taking this time to talk to me. ((hi))Hindi language: ‍आपने मुझसे इतना बात किया, समय निकाला, इसके लिए धन्यवाद।


The names have been altered in the following interview.


((Jaya))  Hi Agastya. Nice to meet you.


Same here Jaya. Are you okay?


((Jaya))  Ya ya.


((WN))  Can you please tell me about yourself?


((Jaya))  Just I will give my introduction [..] I am a sex worker and I am living with HIV-positive for 15 years, and I am practicing sex work for past 15 years also.


((WN))  Okay.


((Jaya))  So, I was in a middle class family, our town was [North Karnataka], so when I was studying in college only, I fell in love with a boy, and because of his caste my family did not accept him and so I left home. I left home and I came, I came to his sisters house. He got me and kept me in his sisters house. So… when I was in his sisters house, things happened and I got pregnant. When I came to know that I am pregnant, I started forcing him to get married.


((Jaya))  And after that when he started avoiding me, his family planned  to marry him off, and they did not tell me about their plan. He told me to stay in his sisters house only, and said to me that he is not well and will be back in about 2 days or a week. He took his sister along with him as well. So they both left. I did have my doubts because I though both of them are going and it might be something important. But I did not know a lot about the world back then, I was from a very strict family, and I was allowed to have deep friendships with anyone, and I really did not know much about the world, I did not know that these type of people existed. So anyway I started trusting them.


((Jaya))  It was a week...then it was 15 days and they had not come back. As they were not back, I asked my lover's sister's husband about them and he suggested that I go where they had gone and check myself. I took their address and went there, and upon enquiring from the neighbours there, I came to know that he is getting to married to so-and-so girl in a temple. Then I told all the people in the neighbourhood there about my story, I told them that he got me and now he has cheated me. But I was alone, who will listen to me? I had no support right so they all just ignored me and told me to come back and talk to the family when they came back.


((Jaya))  When I came back to his sister's house, his sister's husband had locked the door and went away.


So yeah, when I came back the house was locked, his lovers brother-in-law was missing, I did not know where he was and was not able to find him. So I had no place at all. I went to the city bus stand and sat there, the suburban bus stand. I just sat there from the morning till the evening, I was crying, I had nothing, nothing to eat, nothing to do… just nothing. People kept looking at me in a really peculiar way, but somehow I spend the night there. Morning I went to his sisters house again, the family was back. Maybe the neighbours told them I came looking or something, so they had gone to the police and had made a complaint. As soon as I came to the house, the police… a lady constable took me to the police station. They enquired about what happened to me, and then asked for proof for whatever I told them, they asked me to prove it was him I had ran away from my house with, they asked me to prove that the baby was his only. They asked me all of this. They told me to get someone who was on my side on this, I told them that I had no one. They took the address of my home, the superior at that police station made arrangements for me to go with the lady police constable to my town, [in North Karnataka]. We went there. When we reached my home, what happened was… they did not accept me, they outrightly told the lady police constable that I was not their daughter. They told her that their daughter was dead, they told her they did not want me. So again my family just rejected me.


We got back to the police station. Police told me that I had absolutely no one, no family, no one to support me, just no one. I think because of the influence the family of my boyfriend had, and maybe they bribed the police, the police told me that they would file a case on me if I did not leave my boyfriend's family alone or if I create any trouble. I also thought that I could do absolutely nothing by myself and just went back to the bus stand and sat there.


I came back to the bus stand and stayed there the entire day. People at the bus stand started having doubts about why I was at the bus stand all day, both today and the other day. There was a lady there, Rajamma, she worked in the bathrooms of the bus stand. She came to me, sat with me, spoke to me and asked me what had happened and how it happened. Actually she was a broker and I did not know that. I told her all my problems, I told her I was from [North Karnataka], I told her I have studied till class so-and-so, that I was brought here, and then got cheated on. She asked me what I was studying now, I told her I was doing my Pre University Course, PUC. She asked me if she gave me a job would I do it? She asked me how long I will just sit here and cry? She told me that the people here are not good, and that they all looked at me as though I was something really useless and was attracting trouble. She told me that the police are not good either. She asked me what I would do if they were to lock me up in a jail. She told me that I have to be careful also because I was pregnant. She consoled me. And I trusted her also sir! I trusted her, thought about my situation, I had nothing to eat, there was a baby growing in my stomach and so I said yes to the work.


She asked to be in the bus stand with her till her husband came in the evening when her would be over. She told me if anyone came and asked about me, to just tell that I was with Rajamma and that she would come and talk to them. After giving me that trust and confidence in her she got me that days lunch. I had lunch. Her husband came that evening, they took me to their home, it wad a small house, only the husband and wife lived there. They both spoke to me, told me that they will take me to a big city. They told me that I can just keep doing my job there, and that way I would earn a lot of money as well, could have a place and not just keep sitting all day here and there. I agreed. The day after the next day, as I did not have any clothes, she gave me about 4 or 5 of her sarees, helped me pack and took me to the railway station. They took the tickets, settled down, I just remember having a bun and a coffee, that's all. That, is, all I remember. I woke up and was conscious directly at the Mumbai railway station. That is when I realised I was in the Mumbai railway station. In fact, I did not know it was Mumbai, I had only heard of a city named Mumbai, but had never seen it. I was just thinking at that time if I could get a job in such a big city, but was not scared because I knew they were with me. With the confidence I had in them I just went where they took me.


I did not know if I would get a job in that city, but I felt safe that I was with them and just went where they took me. When I went there, it was a huge house, like a really huge house. There were many young girls there, they were all wearing a lot of makeup, and were standing in the corridors and the balconies of the house. I was shocked when I saw this. I did not understand what that place was, but I had seen something similar to this on TV. Now I was scared. Rajamma and her husband told me not to worry, they told me this is my life now and I have to live like this. They advised me to just keep doing my work and everything else will work itself out. But they did not tell me what exactly was the work that they wanted me to keep doing. They told me all the girls here are just like all the other girls and told me that I don't have to worry. They told me that there was a lady in that house who was very close to them, and promised me that she would give me a good job. They took me the house, settled me down there and left.


The first day went by, the second day went by, and then from the third day on they started dressing me up. I did not like it. I told them I did not it and I told them I will not do what they were asking me to do. They told me that I can not doing it now. They told me that Rajamma and her husband had sold me off for money. They told me that they paid for me, that they paid 60,000INR and have to recover the cost now. They told me that I had no choice and I had to do it. That is where my story started. I just kept crying and crying. I stopped eating food. There in that house, there was a girl, she was a Kannadiga, she was from northern Karnataka, she became my friend. She told me that she has the same story too, and that once you come here, they just don't let you go. She asked me for how many days will I just keep crying like this. She told me as I am pregnant also, I at least should do this to have a future for my child. She told me that she will help me.


She told me to just agree to do what they were asking me to do. The tradition there was whenever a new girl came to the house, a Seth [merchant] would come, he is the first client for everyone in the house. Everyone new had to do him first. She told me that Seth was a very nice person, and that if I tell him my story he might help me. I agreed to do the work after this. Once I agreed, he was called. I told him my story. He asked me not to worry. He told me that he will not touch me. He said that he did not want the sin of doing a pregnant woman. He told me to be ready in the morning. He told me not to speak to anyone about this in the house. He said that he will talk to the lady in the house and sort things out. He told me that I will be picked up in the morning. I don't know what he told he told the superior or the lady at the house. I think he told her that he will come in the morning to pick me up. He came to the house the next morning. I was ready when he arrived. He picked me up from the house and took me directly to the railway station. He got me a ticked back to Bangalore. He told to go back to my town, not to trust anyone and to never come back to Mumbai. He gave me some cash, in fact, he also packed food for me for the journey.


Then I came back to Bangalore. As I did not know much about Bangalore. I came back to Mysore. When I came back to the bus stop in Mysore, Rajamma was there. As soon as she saw me she started running away. I went straight to the police station nearly after I saw her and complained there about her. I told them that they took me to Mumbai and sold me. The police caught both of them after that and they were jailed. I never saw Rajamma after that. There I was introduced to Ratnamamma aunty, she was also working in the bus stop. She asked me about my story. I told her everything. She told me that people here are not good and all. I was scared that she would do the same thing what Rajamma did. So I did not pay a lot of attention to her. Neither was I listening to anything she said and did nothing she was asking me to do. A few days later Ratnamma aunty fell in love with a boy working in one of the buses there, Seemanna. They both soon started living together. Seemanna also told me that the people here are not nice and that they might harm me. He told that I am not strong either. He told me that his partner also does the same job. He told me that I could stay with them [Ratnamma and Seemanna] until the delivery. They told me that I did not have to do any work, and that they would never force me to work. But I did not go to their house for two days after they had offered me a place at their house, I was scared the same thing would happen to me again. But after that I went to their home. They took care of me really well sir. They gave me food and treated me well. And never once told me to go work.


Time just passed by like that and I delivered my baby. Baby came and then came a boy in my life, Raju. He was one of the staff in the caterers team. He used to cook at big events like marriages. He asked Ratnamma aunty if he could marry me. He told her that he too had no one, no father, no mother. He also told that he will accept and support the child I had. I agreed. Ratnamma and Seemanna arranged for a room for the 3 of us near Teresian College. That is when I started my life. He was good to me.


Some time after all this he lost his job. Then he started forcing me to go work. He kept telling me that knows I was a sex worker. He kept telling me to stop lying to him about it and just go to work even though I just did not want to do it. He told me that he had given me a chance at normal family life and all that. He forced me to go to work at least for the sake of the child. He started drinking. He would come back home drunk and hit me. So that I would go work. He kept forcing me and at the end I started working as a sex worker.


Whenever I could not earn enough he would get drunk and hit me. I started drinking then actually, I would drink with him too. It had become a routine, when there was money, we would drink, get food and have a good time. When there was no money, he would still drink and hit me. I was just living like this and I met Raghu then. I met him because he was there in the area in which I operate. Before the project came, we were all in our own places. We were good friends, we would share our clients. We told each other about the sex with clients. We used to discuss our problems. We used to do all this and we shared a very special bond, like the bond of siblings, he was like a brother to me. When the members of the project asked Raghu about the female sex workers, he introduced me to them. That is how I became a part of Ashodaya.


I was living like this and one day Raju just started falling ill. We were referred to JSS from the project itself. Dr. Sundar from the project referred us to the JSS hospital. They told us that Raju will be tested to see if he is HIV-positive. The results came, and he was HIV-positive. They sent me to counselling and then I was told that me and my child should also be tested for HIV. Both of us got tested, I was HIV-positive and my daughter was HIV-negative.


((WN))  How old [were you] when all of this happened?


((Jaya))  I was 16 when I left home.  I was 18-19 [when all of these things happened].


((WN))  How has your life changed since you were diagnosed with HIV?


((Jaya))   A lot has changed sir. I thought that the life I had with Raju was all I had. Then I was connected to Ashodaya. I sent my daughter to a hostel, so that she has a good education. I don't want her to have the life I had. I joined a de-addiction centre because I wanted to stop drinking. I do not want the life I had for any other girl, so I started doing things to help beside my sex work. I want to be there for them to help them make the right decisions at the right time. I want to show them the right path. Then I started mingling with everyone so that I could help, I treat them like my own children. In the meetings, we all discuss our problems, everything else that happened with us. After Ratnamma died I became very involved with the community after that.


((WN))  How does a normal day as a sex worker look like for you?


((Jaya))  It is very similar any other household, I am just like the other housewives. I cook breakfast, then I clean the house, then make lunch. Actually not many clients come in the morning. They usually come in the evenings. When I did not have a house of my own I spent most of my day outside, in the parks, in the movie theatres, for time pass, and in the evening I did the sex work. But once I had my own house, I did it most of the times in the evenings only. I am just like the other ladies my age. But I never like telling anyone that I was a sex worker. And I could not tell any one about my problems, because people cringe when they know that I am a sex worker, let alone sharing things with the general population or just a kind neighbour about it. People, especially until a dew years back hated any sex worker in general because they thought that HIV and AIDS exists because of us only, like we were the virus, and not someone infected by the virus. They did not know the main source, most of them. The sigma became lesser and lesser as people were more educated about this. But even today, sex works means some sort of dirty, forbidden taboo. It is considered a bad job, people think it is something horrendous to do.


((WN))  What are the things that you like about your job? And what are the things that you do not like about your job?


((Jaya))  The thing I like the most about this job was that led to understand the pain there is in the society, not just for me, but for everyone. I used to think that I was the only one facing such horrible things in life, but when I interacted with people from the project, I understood that there were many more people facing more difficult problems than me, and have had a tougher journey. Most of them just started doing the sex work because they did not want to die of starvation, or without being able to afford the medicine. If someone is educated they have many options from which they can choose to work, and they also have the support of their family. But we have no support, no skills and it is very difficult. But you do learn a lot in this profession, when we talk to each other, we tell how we got out of so-and-so situation and that is a lesson for everyone else. It is so fascinating sometimes, one person says they have a problem, and before she even finishes telling her problem completely, another person gives a solution, because we share common experience. What I do not like about this is how the society looks at us, it is like we are a big pimple on the face of the society. They don't see sex work as a job, they look at it in a way that is hard to describe, like it is some sin. What they do not understand is that we are not hurting anyone, we aren't robbing anyone, not creating any trouble anywhere that disturbs others or things like that. We offer our body as a service and are making money offering that service. I really want to make them see the point here, I want them see the point, I want to tell them this. People still are not educated and okay about this, and that is something I dislike about this job.


((WN))  Could you tell me more about the work that you do with Ashodaya?


((Jaya))  Ashodaya works for the people of our community. They work for male, female and transgender sex workers. It could be financial help, it could be social help, or even political help. They take care of our health along with our position in our society. We help people of our community come to the main stream. Once people hear the name of Ashodaya, they come to know that it is about the sex workers. There are many things that the people in our community did not have, be it Aadhar card, ration card or a bank account. We got them all these documents, so that they have a proper identity in the society. We did so that they have a equal access to the rights in this society like anyone else. It is hard to do this job and give a proper education to kids, so we connected with many principals and got them admissions in schools so that they could have a good future ahead. We wanted to a mainstream part in the society just like all the other citizens, we took part in many protests, like when there was bomb blast in Bombay, the protests against corruption, the protest for Kavery water etc. So we mingled with all the other people of the society, because we are also a part of the society legitimately and wanted to be highlight that. We wanted to be seen like any other citizen of the society. If there is a death in our community and if the family does not claim the body, we give them a proper farewell with all the last rights. We give help that is required by the members of our community.


Not just that, we have made a co-operative now, because initially we all think that our boyfriends are our only [financial] security and there is a lot of abuse because of this. Now it is Ashodaya is some kind of a [financial] security for them. Before this the people in our community gave all their money to the boyfriends if they had any, but now it is not like that we give them the confidence that they can have a future of their own. So we build this, and many are saving in this only.


But in this COVID situation our lives have just become very difficult now, because first of all we have the burden of one disease, AIDS, and if someone catches Corona, it has not happened yet, and I hope it does not happen, but if it does it is a very difficult thing to handle. Many of us don't have an earning now, we aren't paying the rent, and many have lost their homes because of this. Except a few, most of the members in our community are struggling a lot. We can give so much help at this time now, it is just not possible to give them groceries or medicines that will last for a full month.


((WN))  Do you make enough money to live a comfortable life?


((Jaya))  No sir. First at least we could earn and save, now it is not even possible to earn. Same like how the daily wage workers are facing problems now, we are also having troubles. We don't have a house of our own, no money to pay the rent, it is difficult. We have to look after the education of our kids, we have to look after our own needs, we have to think about the future also sir. It is just not possible with the money we earn.


((WN))  Generally how often do you seek medical check-up?


((Jaya))  We go for check ups every month. We take medicines and survive. A few of them who live far away from the hospitals do it once in 3 months.


[The Ashodaya volunteer mentioned: There was a full time clinic before the lockdown at our Ashodaya office. Most of the sex workers are health conscious. That is the biggest challenge for us now, in the lockdown the HIV patients are not able to access their drugs that they need. We have started giving prescription and counselling online.]


((Jaya))  A few of us are TB patients also, for them we took the permission of police and are delivering drugs to their home. We have asked the government, written many letters for the help for our community during the time of COVID, but we aren't getting much help from there.


((WN))  How have the last 3 months for you been like?


((Jaya))  As I said, they have been very difficult for us, not just for me, they have been very painful for most of the people in my community. As I am one of the leaders in Ashodaya, I call up many people daily to tell them about COVID, to educate them, But what I hear from them is very saddening, they are in a lot of pain and trouble. They are depressed, they see no way of earring now. A few of them have their old parents with them, they do not know how to take care of them anymore, they are worried about their children's education. They tell me that they are not even able to get one proper meal a day, because there are absolutely no clients. We have requests like these everyday for help. We are trying as much as we can to give them groceries or connect them to a doctor. But the most important thing that they need now is food. We are trying to deliver food daily, but we can't do that for a long time, because the cases do not seem to be decreasing, we don't have the resources to keep going like this. We have been thinking a lot about the girls in our community, many have lost their homes, we are trying to find them all a place to live. But this has been one of the very harsh times our community is facing.


There is a girl from our community near my house, she was crying and telling me that Corona has made their life very difficult, we got little money as a sex worker, but at least we did, and we somehow managed our kids and our needs, but now it is very difficult. She told me that wants to die of COVID because that would end her sufferings. I have to talk to her after this interview now. She too is HIV positive, and when things like this happen, they get very emotional, there is nobody to support them, and they fall into deep depression. I am also thinking about how we could get all these people who are depressed out of depression.


((WN))  You said that you wrote to the government of India, the politicians in the ministry of health, did you hear back from them? Did they say anything?


((Jaya))  Absolutely nothing sir. Till now we have got absolutely nothing sir. That is the biggest problem here actually, we spoke to many senior officers, but they all say that it is lockdown and it is not possible to help now. They ask us to come back when everything is normal again. Nobody gave us anything that we could use to help. But we will try again.


((WN))  Tell me about the safety precautions that you have taken during the pandemic.


((Jaya))  We don't go out without a mask anywhere now. We are using sanitisers. We are maintaining social distancing. We have made a batch system. If one goes out one day, then to go out again she will have to wait her turn. We are trying to make the conversations to the phone as much as possible. And if we go out, we come back, wash our hands, legs, face, we then bathe, and wash our clothes. We are also asking others to do the same.


((WN))  Did you have access to an N-95 mask?


((Jaya))  No sir, it was very difficult to get it, but we are using the ones we made at home. Ramdas [local MLA] and ministry of health gave a few masks and some groceries, but we are not supposed to use them after a certain amount of time [3-4 hours], it is not recommended.


((WN))  Did your family support you financially during these few months?


((Jaya))  No sir, no. I have left my family long back, no support from them. This is my story, the others, they have a different story. As I have no family, I am the only one who has to think of my daughter. But for a few, it is not just their daughter, but the full family that they have to take care of. Most of the sex workers are alone, they don't have a family, or, they are the one member in the family who earns.


((WN))  What about your partner? Did they help?


((Jaya))  Most of the partners of the sex workers I know are dependent on the sex workers themselves, so no, they don't help. And even if the partners did help, how much can they help? Not much. They aren't in a good job or anything. Not government jobs, just coolies or things like that. And they also their own families to take care of. Also, they too are very scared to go out and earn in such a situation.


((WN))  Did you look for any alternate source of income in the last 3 months?


((Jaya))  Most of the people in our community are not well educated. A few who have studied a little try to take tuition to the kids in their neighbourhood. But now the schools are also closed. And to be careful during this time, the kids don't  go to tuition. But as most of us are not well educated it is difficult for us to get or do any other job. We are teaching the members of our community to make masks and sanitisers at home so they can for 10INR or 20INR. A few of them are going as daily wage agriculture labours. I mean they have to do something, their needs, rent, kids, family, and parents in a few cases, and if things go wrong they need to see the doctor, and if medicines are prescribed, they need to buy those, can't prioritise in this. It is just not possible to survive without earning. No matter what, at least 2,00INR is required if you want to have a roof over your head.


((WN))  When did you first learn about Corona virus?


((Jaya))  March 21st sir. Initially I thought it was just another virus that caused fever and nothing as serious as HIV. But eventually I realised the gravity of the situation. At least for HIV there is a treatment that is available to the public, but it is not so with COVID, that is my main problem now.


((WN))  What was your initial reaction to the spread of Corona virus and the lockdowns?


((Jaya))  I was really shocked when I heard about the lockdown, I knew what that would mean for the people in my community. This is nothing like the troubles I have faced earlier, I am very worried about the future. I just can't stop thinking if this is how I would have to spend the rest of my life. Many others in my community are thinking the same thing.


((WN))  When did the effects of Corona start reflecting in your life?


((Jaya))  Started effecting my life more than 3 months ago sir.


((WN))  Did you ever get a chance to work in the last 3 months?


((Jaya))  There are absolutely no clients. The clients themselves are very scared, no sex work at all from the past 3 months.


((WN))  When do you plan on resuming your work?


((Jaya))  I just can't predict sir, because this is a chronic disease, and there is no vaccine, I really don't know how the situations will turn out. A few people in my community are ready to wait and struggle for some more time before starting to work again. But the few who are really broke, they really need the money, so they are ready to start working again. Life is really important for them, they don't want to die of starvation, so they really can't take precautions. I am very worried about these people, and just can't stop thinking about the vulnerability of the situation. That is why I am making a lot of phone calls daily.


((WN))  When you start seeing the clients again after the lockdown, what are the precautions that you are going to take?


((Jaya))  Firstly, I really can't practice social distancing with them. If not the client, we will definitely wear a mask all along. It will be compulsory for the client to use a sanitiser. I will just ask him to take what is available and leave [giggles]. Just can't touch anything, you know. We are actually not allowed to travel for sex work now, so we are planning to do whatever it is online only sir. Like tempting them over phone, and having sex over phone. Like setting them up to the mood of sex over phone, but they should satisfy themselves as we help. And they can pay over Google Pay or something like that. Even for those who come to us, we are planning to ask them to sit a certain distance apart, we will help them set the mood for sex, and help them, while they satisfy themselves. But touching them is too risky. That is what all the people in the community are discussing these days. We need to avoid physical sex, and stick to tele sex. Few sex workers in Africa and in the Asia sex workers network proposed to change the positions for better safety. Nothing is sure yet, but sex is physical most of the time, it is going to be hard to maintain social distancing.


((WN))  Apart from Ashodaya community NGO or any other NGO or government provide any aid or help?


((Jaya))  Absolutely nothing sir. Some send over some groceries, except that nothing. The government has a few schemes, but there are problems even with that, most of the aid would go the Schedule Caste or the Schedule Tribes in our community, and that they would have more preference. But our community has people from all the casts, not just the SC/STs. And if most of the aid goes to them, what are the others supposed to do? Groceries somehow we are managing. We have written a letter about the medicines also, but we don't know what their reply to our request will be. And with the schemes, this is the problem. And importantly, we need a shelter, as rent is not affordable anymore. Even though we are working as sex workers, our relatives, neighbours, and friends don't know that. We go the same time the other ladies in the neighbourhood go to work, and its kept a secret like that. And the neighbours are getting doubtful and skeptical about us now, they are stigmatised more now.


((WN))  How is this situation different from 2009, when H1N1 Swine Flu was going around?


((Jaya))  We did not have much issues with it because the treatment came right away and the spread was this fast either. That did not seem very difficult to us, honestly. But here, someone could have no symptoms but can harm you.


((WN))  How old are you and how long do you plan on doing this job?


((Jaya))  I am 40, almost approaching 41 now. I am planning to do it as long I can sir. My daughter also has completed her BA [Bachelor of Arts] and BEd [Bachelor of Education] and has a job now. Once I marry her off my responsibility is less. After that I plan on starting my own business or something.


((WN))  What are the important things you have learnt during your time as a sex worker?


((Jaya))  Majorly, thinking that life will stay the way it is, or the way it is planned it not true. There is too much to learn in life and with that we can make a successful life for us. If one assumes that this is all I can do and just stops putting in the effort, it is not possible to empower oneself with that mentality. We might be in a horrendous situation, but we often forget that we also the skill to deal with that situation. If we just use that skill and try, we can empower ourselves, we can do anything, we can achieve anything, this is a lesson that I have learnt. It is like the saying “Failure is the success in life”. Be confident.


((WN))  What are the things that the government should have done differently according to you so that the situation was better handled?


((Jaya))  They should decriminalised the sex work. Just like how the other jobs are considered a job, if sex work was treated the same way, we would have received the same equality that someone else gets, we won't be stigmatised. That way we could freely be with people and stay in a time where everyone is treated equally. We could have saved ourself a lot of harassment and trouble if things were like that. I want the government to have not just equality of religion or caste, but equality of work too.


((WN))  Well those were all the questions I had for you. Would you like to add anything?


((Jaya))  One request I have is, just writing this article is not important, I want people to understand what the sex workers need. I want to be an example for everyone. Life is much more than just being a sex worker. People need to understand that a sex worker is also a human and will have problems any other human would have. I request the government to help us better in actually delivering the help they promise us. I don't want this article to be read and written with empathy and not sympathy. I want people to just understand our lives through this, and not pity us or feel sad. We want peoples support, not sympathy.


((WN))  Thank you very much for your time, for discussing this and sharing everything that you could possibly. It was really nice speaking to you. I wish you good luck for your life and have a good day ahead.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Don_Blankenship,_U.S._Constitution_Party_presidential_nominee",2020-10-19,"Wikinews interviews Don Blankenship, U.S. Constitution Party presidential nominee","Businessman Don Blankenship of West Virginia, the U.S. Constitution Party's 2020 presidential nominee, answered some questions about his campaign from Wikinews accredited reporter William S. Saturn.


Blankenship, reportedly nicknamed the ""king of coal"", was chairman and CEO of Massey Energy from 2000 to 2010.  During his tenure, the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster occurred, which resulted in the deaths of 29 miners.  A jury convicted Blankenship of misdemeanor conspiracy to violate safety standards willfully, and he received a one year prison sentence in 2016.  He maintains his innocence and blames federal regulators for the disaster.  After his release from prison, Blankenship ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party's US Senate nomination in West Virginia.  He subsequently sought the Constitution Party's nomination for President.  At the virtual 2020 Constitution Party National Convention this past May, Blankenship won the party's nomination on the second ballot.  He selected Michigan Taxpayers Party chairman William Mohr as his running mate.  Mohr spoke about Blankenship with Wikinews in June, describing him as ""a good man with vast knowledge in the political field [who] stands firm on his positions, aligns well with the party platform and has an abundance of ability to lead this nation in the direction it needs to go.""  Mohr lauded Blankenship's ""ability to influence leaders around him"" and claimed the nominee ""has a backbone superior to most men and will be the strongest President we have seen in decades."" 


The Constitution Party was founded in 1991 as the U.S. Taxpayers Party.  It changed to its current name in 1999.  The party advocates states' rights, gun rights, limited government, protectionism, and non-interventionism. It strongly opposes abortion and illegal immigration.  In 2016, the party's presidential nominee Darrell Castle received 203,091 votes (0.15 percent) with ballot access in 24 states.  The Blankenship-Mohr ticket is on the ballot in 18 states with write-in access in a few others.


With Wikinews, Blankenship discussed his background, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on his campaign, what a Blankenship presidency would entail, and policy matters. Additionally, he delivered his final plea to voters ahead of Election Day.


((WSS)) : Which past U.S. president(s) do you most admire and why?


((WSS)) : How have your past experiences prepared you for the job of President?


((WSS)) : How would you describe your style of leadership?  How does it compare to the leadership styles of President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama?


((WSS)) : If you were president, how would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently than President Trump?


((WSS)) : How has the pandemic affected your campaign and your ability to reach out to voters?


((WSS)) : In 2016, Constitution Party presidential nominee Darrell Castle received 203,091 votes, a record for the party.  Based on your general feeling on the ground, about how many votes do you expect to receive in the 2020 election?


((WSS)) : What would a Blankenship administration look like?  Which specific individuals would you ask to be in your cabinet?


((WSS)) : Who would you nominate to the Supreme Court?  Would you apply any litmus tests?  Should the number of justices remain at nine?


((WSS)) : As president, how would you work with Congress to avoid gridlock and pass your agenda?


((WSS)) : What should be done, from the government's perspective, to combat global climate change?


((WSS)) : What are your views on the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan?  What would you do as president to help resolve the conflict and how does that comport with your overarching philosophy on foreign affairs?


((WSS)) : Are you concerned about the deplatforming and social media censorship of notable conservatives and libertarians?  How would you address this issue as president?


((WSS)) : What can you do, as president, to improve race relations in the United States?


((WSS)) : Election Day is quickly approaching and early voting has already started in some states. What is your final plea to voters?

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Wikinews_interviews_2020_Melbourne_Lord_Mayor_Candidate_Wayne_Tseng,2020-10-22,Wikinews interviews 2020 Melbourne Lord Mayor Candidate Wayne Tseng,"2020 Melbourne Lord Mayor candidate Wayne Tseng answered some questions about his campaign for the upcoming election from Wikinews.  The Lord Mayor election in the Australian city is scheduled to take place this week.


Tseng runs a firm called eTranslate, which helps software developers to make the software available to the users.  In the candidate's questionnaire, Tseng said eTranslate had led to him working with all three tiers of the government.  He previously belonged to the Australian Liberal Party, but has left since then, to run for mayorship as an independent candidate.


Tseng is of Chinese descent, having moved to Australia with his parents from Vietnam.  Graduated in Brisbane, Tseng received his PhD in Melbourne and has been living in the city, he told Wikinews.  Tseng also formed Chinese Precinct Chamber of Commerce, an organisation responsible for many ""community bond building initiatives"", the Lord Mayor candidate told Wikinews.


Tseng discussed his plans for leading Melbourne, recovering from COVID-19, and ""Democracy 2.0"" to ensure concerns of minorities in the city were also heard.  Tseng also focused on the importance of the multi-culture aspect and talked about making Melbourne the capital of the aboriginals.  Tseng also explained why he thinks Melbourne is poised to be a world city by 2030.


Tseng's deputy Lord Mayor candidate Gricol Yang is a Commercial Banker and works for ANZ Banking Group.


Currently, Sally Capp is the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, the Victorian capital.  Capp was elected as an interim Lord Mayor in mid-2018 after the former Lord Mayor Robert Doyle resigned from his position after sexual assault allegations.  Doyle served as the Lord Mayor of Melbourne for almost a decade since 2008.


Can you tell us something about yourself?


((Wayne Tseng))  [I am an] Australian Citizen of Chinese descent [and] fluent Cantonese, Mandarin and English speaker.  Born in Vietnam and migrated to Australia with parent in the 1990s.  Graduated as a computer engineer in Brisbane and received a PhD in Melbourne.  Lectured in RMIT University before launching [my] firm eTranslate.


I authored two teaching texts: Open Learning, Introduction to Project Management and Open Learning, Introduction to Assembly Language.


The firm which shares the same name as the USA firm eTranslate (but not related) specialises in language expertise and language information technology.  The firm has two arms — The technology arm focuses on services to help developers to create language variants of their software.  The language/cultural services arm provides cultural communication services to local government.  Australia is a lot of ethnic minorities speaking over 120 languages and over 80 cultures.


As the firm grew, I spent more [...] time in the cultural communication services arms.  There I served as the principal consultant leading a team which delivered consultancy services to all three levels of government in Australia.


I also founded the non-profit organisation Chinese Precinct Chamber of Commerce which was responsible for a lot of Australia first Chinese and Australia community bond building initiatives.  I have a passion for community activities that leads to the betterment of Australians.


In 2014 I invented the Australian Chinese Zodiac which matches the Chinese zodiac animal with the Australia local wildlife.  The design was aim[ed] to promote better understanding between Chinese and Australian community.  It went viral.


I always have been active in politics.  [I] was a member of the Australian Liberal Party and participated in a federal election.


During my time in politics, I saw the limits of Australia's Westminister system.  This system was designed by the British government to be used in its colonies in 1842.  It assumed that the colonies do not have their own ideals and follow just one single set of social values.  The system only allows a government and an opposition.  These are often occupied by either the Progressive — The LEFT (Labour Party) and the Conservative — the RIGHT (the Liberal Party).


However, 21st Century Australia is much more culturally diverse.  There are different ideals and social values.  Australian[s] can not see themselves fit into either the LEFT or the RIGHT ideology online.  The people of Australia is more comfortable with fit for purpose policies or CENTRE.  The current system does not support a third centre party.


In fact, Australians have become more cynical about the two major parties (LEFT and RIGHT).  They are well educated and well informed.  They believe they can offer the government so much in input and suggestions.  They want to have more say in the governing of [...] Australia.


I have since come to the belief that direct vote or participating democracy is the key for the next stage of the country's evolution.  This is [a] movement overseas in terms of direct vote or direct democracy.


In Australia, I believe introduction of direct voting needs to be [a] gradual process.  Laws needs to be enacted to allow direct voting.  But before this, the public and [sitting] government needs to see the benefit of direct democracy.


((WN))  What made you decide to run for the Melbourne City's Lord Mayor?  Why do you think you should be the Melbourne's Mayor?


((Wayne Tseng))  In [the] 2020 Melbourne local government election, I was nominated for the Lord Mayor of Melbourne.  I hope to use the election as a platform to seed public awareness on participating democracy.


I advocated for the creation of a platform called Participate in Melbourne where the people can begin with submitting their issues/concerns, offer suggestions, hold public debate and send those conclusions to elected councillor to deliberate and vote.  [I] hope once the benefits are known, the council will enact laws to allow direct vote.


I have founded an organisation called eTranslate that has offices in different countries.  Over the years, [I] have gained a considerable amount of business and life experiences which are important in public life.


Apart from my professional life, I have always engaged in community work.  I have a passion to enter public office and serve the community in a larger capacity.


I have always been active in politics.  I was a member of the Australia Liberal Party and participated in a federal election.


During my time in politics, [I] understood the inner workings of major parties and the Australian political system.
Most importantly, I have lived in Melbourne since 2000 and understand the city intimately as a business operator and as a resident.


((WN))  [C]ould you please explain what are the powers of Melbourne's Lord Mayor?


((Wayne Tseng))  Unlike the City of London where its local government administer London CBD [Central Business District] and greater London, the City of Melbourne is divided in 76 areas and the Melbourne City Council only administer the Melbourne CBD and two surrounding residential areas, Docklands and Southbank.


While the area Melbourne City Council administer is small, the Melbourne CBD (second only to Sydney) is the engine of Australia's Economy.  So [while] the scope of power is limited, the policies are wide-ranging.  The Lord Mayor of Melbourne is partly a ceremonial role and partly a directorship role.  It is like the Chairman of a company.  The CEO of the council has all the executive powers.  But the mayor and the councillors are like the board of directors and the chairperson.  The only difference is that this chairperson sets the agenda for the CEO to implement.  The chairperson drafts the agenda based on the wishes of the people — the voters.


((WN))  Tell us about your team Zorin.  Tell us about your partner Gricol Yang.


((Wayne Tseng))  As required by the Victoria Election Authority.  All candidates that contest for the seat of Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor must form a team for ease of identification.


So I choose Team Zorin as a name that represented me, Wayne Tseng — Lord Mayor Candidate and Gricol Yang — Deputy Lord Mayor Candidate.


I chose Zorin because I also have another company called Zorin Industries which specialise in Robotics.  The name will only last until the result of the election is known.


Gricol Yang obtained a degree in commerce and worked in the ANZ Banking Group as a Commercial Banker.


((WN))  You ran in an election as a representative of the Liberal party in 2010 — why did you quit the party?  What have you learned since leaving the Liberals?


((Wayne Tseng))  I quit the party so I can run as an independent in the council election.  I am pursuing direct democracy which is not an element of the Australian Liberal Party platform.


However, during the time as a member of the Liberal party, I have learnt so much about...


((WN))  Tell us about your company eTranslate.


((Wayne Tseng))  I founded the firm eTranslate which shares the same name as the USA firm eTranslate (but not related).  We specialise in language expertise and language information technology.  The firm has two arms — The technology arm focuses on services to help developers to create language variants of their software.  The language/cultural services arm provides cultural communication services to local government.  Australia is a lot of ethnic minorities speaking over 120 languages and over 80 cultures.  We have offices across Australia and in selected countries.


Some of our past achievements include:


We also won a number of awards for our innovations.


((WN))  In the Candidate Questionnaire and Answers, you had listed operating eTranslate has given you expertise in undertaking the role of Councillor.  How?  Can you please explain?


((Wayne Tseng))  As the firm grew, I spent more of [my] time in the cultural communication services arms.  There I served as the principal consultant leading a team which delivered consultancy services to all three levels of government in Australia.


[A] politician needs business and life experience so they can make decisions that address real business and life situations.


So I do believe after years of growing and operating a business in so many areas, I could be of a service to the city.


((WN))  What do you think of the current governance of Melbourne's Mayor?


((Wayne Tseng))  The current mayor, Sally Capp, entered mid-term when the previous mayor Robert Doyle was outsed for sexual harassment allegation.


I do appreciate the hard work Sally did to bridge the political divide in a council chamber she inherited.  This year the pandemic has made her work even harder as for any other leaders.  But what she fall short off is to stand up to the State Government (provincial government) which [has] restricted the city ability to take its own decisive action to better protect the city.


She is Labor aligned so she can not compromise too much of the Labor State Government reign.  But a local government needs to be separate [from] State government so it can exercise its power to protect [its] constituents.


((WN))  Could you please [tell] us about the 'Precision Policies'?


((Wayne Tseng))  Team Zorin pledge to bring all Melbournians to the council chamber.  We will deploy an online platform to let Melbournians participate in the running of the city.  You can post issues in your area, submit your solutions, raise alerts about wrong doing, rate your councillors action and comment on council decisions.  It's called Participating Democracy.  We pledge not only [to] formulate policies for the majority, but also [to] formulate precise policies for the minority.  We called this Precision Policies.


You see the majority rule in current democracy.  If you are in the minority, you will not be in luck.  Our participating democracy platform ensure[s] that the needs of everyone includ[ing] those in minority group are captured.  The government should work harder to ensure there are policies that precisely addressed the needs of everyone including minority group.  Thus Precision Policies.


((WN))  What are some of the things you can bring to [the] table if you were to be elected as the Lord Mayor?


((Wayne Tseng))  Many other candidates in the election only advocate big spending and relief in payment of taxes.  Just like the Spanish Flu that shaped the 20th century, COVID-19 is shaping our time and the city is ill prepared for the post COVID world.  Our council processes and bureaucracies are still paper base, our revenue model is not flexible to enable rapid recovery and take advantage of new opportunity.


My strategy is to Re-open, Reset, Reform as part of Melbourne Recovery.  There is a comprehensive plan for recovery in all sectors from business to residents.  See attached document.


((WN))  What does Melbourne lack under Sally Capp's Mayorship which you plan on improving?


((Wayne Tseng))  Sally['s] current strategy is to spend to recovery.  While this is necessary, fundamental reforms are needed.


My strategy is to Re-open, Reset, Reform as part of Melbourne Recovery.


Key Reforms include:


Make Melbourne a full digitally transformed city with intelligent systems.


Melbourne needs an efficient platform to recover and to seize new opportunities.  Some of our processes and bureaucracies are still paper base.  The tech needed are already available and proven models of digitisation are easily accessible.  We should move towards full digitisation plus installation of intelligent systems.  In simple jargon, these intelligent systems can enable efficiency projects such as:


This new platform will be Melbourne ""Digital Railway"" to recovery.


Make Melbourne the first to reform council rate calculation.


Post COVID Melbourne will see many empty shops, office floors and rental apartments.  This is in addition to the many heritage-listed and old CBD properties that are not rentable but incredibly valuable.  The current council rate calculation which is based on property value will send these owners off the cliff.


Our team advocate a fundamental change to how council rate is calculated — based on yield and property value.  A property of high value that remains vacant can receive lower rate bill.  This will give relief but also give incentive for the property to attract new tenants.  For commercial property where the tenant pays for the outgoing, the reduced rate bill will help to attract new tenants and relief for the tenant to grow their business.


The same applies to heritage-listed properties and residential rental properties.  The list of beneficiaries is long.


Make Melbourne an active Jobweaver.


In some of candidates' campaigns have been alluded Job — Job — Jobs; unfortunately, reality is we know old industries including retail will not return the same number of jobs.  So where will new jobs come from.  Local government should enact policies and implement initiatives to attract new industries.  While the federal government hands out Job Maker financial assistance, local government should implement ""Job Weaver"" initiatives to attract new industries.


While one candidate stated he has attracted a billion-dollar project to Melbourne, little of this money trickles to small businesses and local workforce.  Melbourne's well-educated workforce can attract industries such as Robotics, AI Systems, Smart Financial Services and Accreditation Services.  The key to attract these new industries is the development of the e-engagement platform.


Australia [may] enter a new NATO style trade pack with US, Japan, India, and other friendly nations.  With so many Indian students and professions in Australia, Melbourne can seize the opportunity to be the business and finance center to administer these new alliances.  Again, an efficient digital e-engagement platform is the key to seize these opportunities.


((WN))  On Team Zorin's website, you wrote ""Melbourne is too precious to be used as a test lab for half-baked policies.""  What are some of the current policies that are under-serving the residents of Melbourne?


((Wayne Tseng))   There are many current policies that are not working and under serving.  Here are two examples:


The Melbourne city council [...] advocate for more residential towers and approve[d] a lot which is under construction.  But there are no essential services in these areas to service residents.  Essential services such as doctor, dentist, child care, mental health services and women's health services are almost non-existent.


Here is my advocacy: There is little on other candidates' platforms for Melbourne as Residential Precinct.  There is a Chemist Warehouse in every block.  But where to go when you are sick at night.  Our team propose to attract essential services (such as 24 hours super-clinic) to service Melbourne residents including GPs, dentist, childcare, radiology, mental health, men's health, women's health and crisis management.  We have over 50,000 students in Melbourne; however, they are not entitled to free medical at St Vincent even with a medical insurance.  Gary Morgan rightly said, young family will settle in CBD, but where do they send their children for childcare, early learning, kindergarten, primary and secondary schools.  Schools will lift apartment resale value.  New apartments are being approved but with little green space and essential services.  This will be failed.


Melbourne City council advocate to re-open business but there is not enough measure to make sure the premises are COVID safe.


This is my advocacy: Make Melbourne the first to install a city-level outbreak detection team.


A hard COVID lesson learnt is that outbreak needs to be contain fast.  COVID-19 will not be the last.  There are also frequent gastro outbreaks.  Our team propose Australia first city-level Rapid Response, Virus education / awareness, Outbreak Detection and Containment Team (jokingly called Bug Busters).  While we may not like to mention it, China's city level Bug Busters are key for them to contain outbreaks.


In addition, we advocate installation of health check gates at shopping centers and places of high people concentration.  These gates will not only measure temperatures but will have regularly updated features to detect other symptoms.  Just like security check points, they will become part of the post-COVID world.  They may be integrated as part of security and drug checks.  (The technology is already in used overseas).


Think again, this along with PPE when mandated and social distancing is the key to safe opening.


((WN))  On your website, you wrote ""Team Zorin pledges to bring all Melbournians to the council chamber"" — how do you plan to do that?  How will this affect people of Melbourne?  What technologies would you require to achieve that?


((Wayne Tseng))  The phrase bring all Melbournians to the council chamber is a metaphor.  The reality is that all Melbournians will have their opportunity to submit their issues and their suggestions into the digital democracy platform.  They can participate in virtual debate and trials.  Those findings will be submitted to the council chamber for formal debate.  Now even if the laws do not allow direct vote, the platform has online polls to allow the people to vote.  The elected councillors can see the ""wish"" of the people and voted accordingly.  Thus — ""Bring the Melbournians to the council chamber"".


To a number of Melbournians who have been so stressed and depressed, it will take sometime for them to appreciate the opportunity to have their say.  At the same time, so many Melbournians are tired and fed up with the current mayor for the lack of real solutions and the state government errors and mistakes, they will look for alternatives.


I believe instead of installing another leader who is not going to be any wiser or someone who just want[s to] offer sensationalism just to win power, this is the time where we open the pathway to collective governing.  The direct democracy or participating democracy (depends on who is framing this concept) will allow Melbournians to work collectively, find out solutions, TRIAL solutions, hold [...] forum and see what really works and then tell their leader to consider these well-founded solutions.


It does not affect the people of Melbourne other than giving them a new avenue to seek their answers.  It will put the elected official on notice that people demand more, want to take part in the process of governing.  Also the demand for greater transparency.


There are emerging technologies for participating democracy.


MiVote is one prominent technology using blockchain to enable secured voting.  Since the model on how direct democracy is going to unfold, the technologies are catching up with the needs of the people.


For the first time in digital revolution, it is technology that is catching up with the people.  In this case, it is the digital democracy platform trying to the catch up with the inspiration of the people.  Other less sophisticated ones include WordPress with template UpVote.


((WN))  What do you think of one's right to privacy?  Will the people of Melbourne have to compromise a part of their privacy to accommodate to your plans for the city?


((Wayne Tseng))  Australia has a very strong privacy protection law. By participating in the democracy platform, the people would not disclose much of their details other than:


((WN))  How would you ensure the digital platform you intend to deploy for residents to participate for the running of city is not misused?  In what ways will you ensure only the residents of the city can use it?  Will the platform use user's privacy respecting software?


((Wayne Tseng))  The model in which how this participating democracy works itself will also be debated.  Of course, I will seed the initial model.


The initial model do not allow anonymous posts or vote.  Every one [who] contributes must verify that they are registered voters against the voters roll in the election authority.  The voting itself are base on block chain which is the most secure we now have.


The software will respect Australia privacy law.


((WN))  How do you plan to help those Melbournians who are in the economically weaker category?


((Wayne Tseng))  The homeless and people living below the poverty line are part of the Melbourne community.  On policy, the council will rent back empty home to give temporary shelter to the homeless or reduce rental for those who are economically weaker.


((WN))  Statistics show number of crimes reported in various cities in Australia including Melbourne have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.  How do you plan on handling the COVID-19 pandemic?  What policies would you introduce to reduce the rate of crimes in Melbourne?


((Wayne Tseng))  On my policy platform, we have advocate[d] for night safe zones, additional CCTV and patrols.  We will work with the police department (run by the state government) to ensure they monitor the parts of the city that pose higher risks.


((WN))  Why do you think ""Melbourne is poised to be a world city by 2030""?  What are some of the things necessary for ensuring that comes true?  What are some of the current barriers which may prevent that from happening?  How would you remove those barriers?


((Wayne Tseng))  Australia is an island continent.  It has the world largest iron, lithium, uranium and rare earth reserve[s].  It has the most agriculturally sound land.  It has every geographical [feature] you can find [on] earth.  There is enough land to support a population of 2 billion.


Melbourne like Sydney is a business, administrative and cultural centre.  Yet it does not have the financial burden of being the largest city in Australia.


Melbourne can seize the opportunity to be administration centre of the new opportunities.  From new opportunities comes [new] found wealth and city development.


But what is stopping the city is its old paper base bureaucracies.  This is why I advocate full digital transformation of council processes and install new smart systems.  I also advocate the development of a[n] e-engagement system which allow[s] new industries from overseas to quickly engage with the City of Melbourne.


((WN))  Tell us about ""Guided Governing"".  How would that play out?  Your campaign talks about Democracy 2.0.  What are the things where democracy is currently failing?  How do you plan to fix it?


((Wayne Tseng))  In the Democracy 1.0, the majority rules.  If you are a minority, you[r] needs may not be addressed.


Melbourne is so much more than those issues raised by the mayoral candidates.  The recovery needs to include everyone, not just those whose needs are on the candidates' policy platform.


Melbournians will no longer accept that if your needs are not on their agenda, [bad] luck try again in 4 years.  A lot can happen in 4 years.  One COVID-19 lesson is to address issues head on, fast and with well-founded solutions.  We can see from Stage 4, there were mistakes — 50 mistakes as the Herald Sun reported.


We understand politicians are human, there is a limit to how much they know — especially career politicians.  Melbournians as a collective can offer so much.  Take my extensive policies.  In fact, the list is much longer.  These are real issues submitted by people at the ground level including suggestions by the people on my mini digital democracy platform.


For example, when Sally advocated for the expansion to Southbank Boulevard and big events, residents in Southbank already unhappy at sound levels rejected this completely.  They advocate that the council should enforce a quiet zone after 10pm at residential areas.  This is on my platform.


Melbournians can submit their observations of any failures.  One election issue is the self-injecting room (I know it is the state government who put it there).  While every candidate concedes having one near QVM [Queen Victoria Market] and near residential towers is bad, no candidate mentioned that there are dealers hovering 150 meters away supplying the goods creating an epicentre of drug deals around the self-injecting room.  Chinese students living in EQ towers on A'beckett street  reported this on my platform even if they are not voters.


You see citizen participating can also stop bad policy in its track, this is guided governing.


Melbournians can offer topics/suggestions that the candidates don't see.  As a collective they have a greater foresight.  In my policy document, topics discussed include:


These potential ideas and virtual forum findings can be submitted to the council chamber for councillors to debate guided by the evidence presented.  Of course the current laws do not allow citizens to directly vote on council decisions.  But Melbournians can conduct their votes on online polls.  The result will show the councillors in the chamber the wish of the people.  If they do not vote reflecting the wish of the people, they will know their [fate] come next election.


If I was to be elected, I will take gradual steps to introduce a platform for participation and direct vote.


My plan is to expand ""Participate Melbourne "" to empower Melbournians to


It goes further:


((WN))  Why do you plan to make Melbourne Australia's capital?


((Wayne Tseng))  Melbourne was Australia capitol until 1927.  Then it was moved to Canberra.


The indigenous people of Australia do have rights.  But their identity and their rights are either suppressed or not encouraged.


I want to use Melbourne public space to be a place where the First Nations (Indigenous) people can hold their discussion forum.  I want to have the map of their different tribes displayed in Town Hall.


I also want a day where we have the Indigenous festival.


((WN))  You have plans to create a city level disease detection swat unit and to install temperate and health check gates — how much time would it take to do it all across Melbourne?  How much resources and funds are you planning to put behind the disease prevention of the city?


((Wayne Tseng))  I am [not(?)] privy to council records.  So I don't have all the tools to calculate.  But because the area that Melbourne City Council is small.  I can work out the budget.  I may budget to be the same that the city is spending now controlling the outbreak.


((WN))  Your manifesto also mentions reviewing ""animal management plan"" — could you tell us more about it?


((Wayne Tseng))  Pets are not support[ed] and unwanted in City of Melbourne.  The current animal management plan advocates if lost pets are not claimed within a certain number of days they are killed.


Many people who moved from the suburbs to the city often left their pets on the streets.  This is sad.


I think we should be compassionate.  I will definitely review the pet plan and called it ""Creatures big and small care plan"".


((WN))  How do you plan to preserve the indigenous art and support multi-cultural aspect of the city?


((Wayne Tseng))   Mining companies frequently blasted sacred aboriginal sites destroying precious aboriginal artwork.  Some of their art work are actually dumped in shipping containers.  Melbourne has so many public galler[ies] and museums. They can be commission to preserve, store and exhibit aboriginal artworks.


((WN))  Given the owners profit from pairing up with Airbnb which hikes the house rent — what is your stance on Airbnb and similar short-stay rentals and their long-term effect on affordability?


((Wayne Tseng))  Airbnb and similar short-stay rental are [an] important source of income for city apartment landlords.  Yet they are also a source of disturbances for residents.  Residents deserve peace and enjoyment.


So Airbnb needs to be regulated.  My plan is to have public consultation where all stakeholders get to have a say on the digital democracy platform and hold a virtual forum.


Some of the initial key consideration[s] include:


((WN))  What are some of the strongest criticisms you have received for your plans for Melbourne?  How did those criticisms change your views?


((Wayne Tseng))  My policies for the city of Melbourne have been collectively suggested by talking to the people of Melbourne through my digital participating democracy platform.  So they are populist policies.  Few actually criticise them.


However, there is one major challenge.  The current tension between Chinese and Australia fuel public speculation about why so many Chinese candidate.  They are worried about foreign infiltration.  While I enjoy pretty good coverage, many other Chinese/Asian candidates are being teased or harassed.  Overall, this does not give a good public image for all Chinese/Asian candidates.  Any voters who [do] not know me, may not vote for me because I have a Chinese face.


((WN))  If you had to vote for the current candidates other than yourself for this year's election, which three candidates would you vote for?  Why?


((Wayne Tseng)) 


((WN))  What are some of the reasons people may not vote for Team Zorin?


((Wayne Tseng))  Reasons:


((WN))  In case if you do not win the election, what would be your next plan of action?


((Wayne Tseng))  [My] goal is to leverage on the friend and networks [I have] developed to further advance participating democracy in Australia.


During the time as a candidate, I have used any publicity available to promote the concept.  I have written to the following part[s] of society:


I hope to promote the concept to all level[s] of society so they will become more educated and understand its benefits.  So when future government can enact direct vote, the great people of Australia can easily follow.


I will formally form a party called Zorin Australia which will attract member[s] across Australia through the democracy platform.


We will also gradually establish a nation-wide democracy platform where the great people of Australia continue to post their issues, solutions, vision, hopes and advise the government on the course of governing.


The various champions on the platform can be great candidate[s] to represent the people come next election.


((WN))  What do you think of world dominance?


((Wayne Tseng))  I do not believe in world dominance.  The whole point of the participating democracy or Democracy 2.0 is to give the power to determine by the people.


The people collaborate in their own community.  The different communities collaborate in a city.  Cities collaborate in a state/provinces.  Provinces collaborate in a country.  Countries collaborate together as part of one cohesive entity.


Of course, this is a utopia that is not going to happen anytime soon.  But it is a model that we hope where countries at different stage of readiness will adopt.  Step by step humanity improves.


Imagine we have a new martian colony.  What kind of government will we want to be there.  We will likely want something like participating democracy, everyone['s] needs are address, everyone collectively decides.  So if this is what is in the future, why can['t] we start to slow[ly] adopt this model today.


((WN))  What does the demographic of Melbourne currently look like?


((Wayne Tseng))  According to 2016 census:


Children aged 0–14 years made up 3.8% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 5.1% of the population.  Of people in Melbourne (State Suburbs) aged 15 years and over, 23.7% were married and 5.8% were either divorced or separated.


0.5% of the population, or 24,062 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.  Melbourne has the 10th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas.  In Greater Melbourne at the 2016 census, 63.3% of residents were born in Australia.


((WN))  How do you plan on making Melbourne the Repository for Cultural Artefacts and Knowledge?


((Wayne Tseng))  I always believe knowledge is humanity['s] biggest achievement.  Yet they are constantly be[ing] destroy[ed] by successive regime who see certain part do not align with their ideology.  It happens all around the world.


But I [don't] want to be racist.  I am Chinese.  So I can comment on China.  For a millenni[um] each imperial dynasty aim[ed] to destroy the knowledge and culture of those that were not compatible with their regime.


The biggest destruction was [by] the Qin (Chin) emperor when he unified China.  Even to this day, the Chinese Cultural Revolution has further destroy[ed] what was traditional China.


We see it in Afghanistan, Syria and even in Australia.


There are a large part of Australia society which love truth, knowledge and fairness.


Australia for the time being is very stable politically.  The country geographic is stable with no earthquakes and volcanoes.  Humidity is low and weather stable.


To sum it up, it is a country suitable to [store] artefact[s] and knowledge that are at risks in their host country.  The benefit for Australia is that the world will come and see, bring[ing] tourism.


The artefacts will only be preserve[d] here with consent of the traditional owners.


((WN))  Are you aware of the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museum) outreach project run by Wikimedia?  Do you look forward to facilitating the outreach for mutual benefit?  How would you facilitate that?


((Wayne Tseng))  I did not know until now.  I understand what is GLAM.  I think it can serve as a great preservation of culture, artefact while Wikipedia is for the preservation of knowledge.  I will look into it in the future.


((WN))  What according to you is more important: Representation of minorities in the council or minority citizens getting a platform to express their needs, and grievances?  Why?  What are your plans to achieve that?


((Wayne Tseng))  It's democracy in Australia.  The City administration changes after each election.  Certain administration may be pro-minority, some may not.  Some administration may have good minority representation, some may not.


So it is important that there is a platform which empowers the minority to post their needs and discuss their preferences.  [By] law if issues are known, they need to be addressed by the government.


So it will be ideal that we get both good minority representation in government and the platform to support them.  But the former can not be guaranteed.


((WN))  Why did you start eTranslate? What type of advice does it provide to the three tiers of government?


((Wayne Tseng))  eTranslate has two arms — the Technology arm — which focus on empowering technologies to support multicultural user needs and multilingual content.


The other is multicultural communication services — It is a like a Public Relation service but focus on ethnic groups.  So our team provide this multicultural PR services to government.  We empower the government clients with language resources, cultural expertises and ethnic media channel to interact with their ethnic minority constituents.


So we work with all levels of government.


((WN))  What are some of the problems ethnic minorities face in Melbourne?


((Wayne Tseng))  Due to low fertility rate, Australia has [to] constantly embark on increasing migration to top up its population.  As such, there is a diverse set of ethnic minority groups in fact over 80.  Australia treat[s] its minority well compare to other OECD [(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)] countries.  But when you have so many group[s] competing for government priorities, it is hard to find a balance.


Most of the time, the larger minority group[s] gain more access to resources.  This is why my participating democracy platform helps to ensure the needs of all minority groups are identified and addressed — Thus Precision Policies.


((WN))  What percentage of residents in Melbourne and Victoria are aboriginals?


((Wayne Tseng))  Melbourne 0.5%, Victoria 1.6%.


((WN))  Aboriginal population in Melbourne and in Victoria is very low as compared to other states. Why? And would it make sense to make Melbourne capital of Aboriginals when there aren't enough of them in the city?


((Wayne Tseng))  The distribution of indigenous people depends on a lot of factors.  These again due to historical reasons that we can go on forever.  The are tens of indigenous tribes across the country.  Sadly some were hunted to extinction in the last century, particularly in Tasmania.


Mak[ing] a location a capital for the First Nations people will be symbolic rather than totally enshrine[d] in law.  Ideally it would be best in the City of Darwin.  But unless I was a mayor there, it may not happen.


So having [it] in Melbourne does allow some symbolic and provide a forum for the different tribes to gather and have open discussions.


The ""capital"" can rotate from city to city periodically if other cities allow.  But ultimately it will be up to the elders to approve.


((WN))  How [do] you envision Melbourne would look like by 2025 under your mayorship?


((Wayne Tseng))  Each mayor term is 4 years, that takes it to 2024 at the latest.  Realistically, Melbourne and Australia being a much smaller economy will take longer to recover from COVID-19.


So to be practical, we hope the city will attain the following by 2024-25:


((WN))  If elected, what would constitute a successful mayorship for you?


((Wayne Tseng))  I believe what constitute a successful mayorship are


Wayne Tseng also shared his insights on various things on how collaboration between the members of society,


((Wayne Tseng))  Just [to] summarise:


Since I was 10, I watched how the ant[s] collaborate.  I asked how we people can collaborate further.  In school, I appreciated competition bring creativity.  But I also believe collaboration ensures not only creativity, but accountability, responsibility, integrity and productivity.


When I was in university, my computer studies focused on collaborative computing.  My post graduate research was on software globalisation — again global collaboration.


My company eTranslate really aims to empower companies to go global while in Australia assist all ethnic minority groups collaborate and co-exist in harmony.


In politics, I seek to find a solution where we can reach consensus.  It does not have to be LEFT or RIGHT, black or white.  Democracy is one system that endures, but it is no longer acceptable to just say majority rules.  This led me to participating democracy or Democracy 2.0.


Once can say — So my life experience really led me towards participating democracy or Democracy 2.0.


((Wayne Tseng))  Democracy 2.0:


When I gave presentation, I always said if there is a Mars Colony now, what kind of political system or government would you prefer: Authoritarianism, Communism, Fascism, Monarchy or Democracy?


If Democracy, do you want to be squeeze[d] to either the LEFT or the RIGHT or only majority rules?  Or may be you want a collective government where the needs of everyone is addressed.  So that's participating democracy.  Now if that is the future, why don't we progress towards this TODAY.


I have developed an index to measure to what degree a country has adopted participating democracy.  I share this in the future topic.


((Wayne Tseng))  Society 1.0:


While developing the model for participating democracy, I saw many institutions have refined processes and some have matured to a point where it is like a car.  The [model], functions and overall attributes of a car is matured.


Imagine that we put all the attributes of an institution whether a health system, a hospital, a school or an education department in a bottle.  We can deploy this to other countries that have [not] yet got such a matured setup.


Now imagine we got a whole matured community or city setup in bottle, this can be deploy to new city setup in the dessert or new settled land.


Now imagine after exchanging and further developing these setup.  Eventually, like a car which is quite mature, we have a setup or definition of a city or SOCIETY that is almost universally accepted.  I call this SOCIETY 1.0.


Democracy 2.0 can lead to SOCIETY 1.0.  The ongoing debate of how to govern a society will lead to a universally agreed FORMAT/SETUP/DEFINITION of a SOCIETY.


During COVID-19, the ability of different medical centres to collaborate in the development and trialling of different vaccine candidates showed the need to standardise setup of clinics, hospital and even the health ministry.  Those that are compatible and matured progressed further.


It will take a moment to sink it.


((Wayne Tseng))  Collectivism 1.0:


Collaboration and Collectivism if well structured or modelled can be the next BIG step in human achievement.


We see collaboration between students.  Let say this has a productivity factor of 4 (where 1 is a person working on his own)


We see collaborat[ion] of different team[s] working together each focusing on a part of the problem.  This has the productivity factor of 16.


However if there is [a] well defined guide to community collaboration where the high number of participants can explore all different permutation[s] of a problem, the productivity factor can be 256.  Add in computation power.  We are talking about a factor of 65,536.  It will expand humanity achievements.


Back to my childhood observation — the numbers do count in creativity and productivity.


The holy grail is to find that magic collaboration model.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Phil_Collins,_U.S._Prohibition_Party_presidential_nominee",2020-10-22,"Wikinews interviews Phil Collins, U.S. Prohibition Party presidential nominee","U.S. Prohibition Party presidential nominee Phil Collins took some time to answer a few questions about his 2020 presidential campaign from Wikinews accredited reporter William S. Saturn.


Collins is currently chairman of the Prohibition Party.  Previously, he served as a trustee of Libertyville Township (Illinois) and as chairman of the Prohibition Party of Illinois. After moving to Nevada, he ran for Mayor of Las Vegas in 2019, and finished in second place overall.  He was not the Prohibition Party's first choice for the 2020 presidential nomination.  In November 2018, the party nominated a ticket of Bill Bayes for President and C.L. Gammon for Vice President. Bayes withdrew in March 2019. Gammon assumed the presidential nomination and the party nominated Collins for Vice President the next month.  Gammon withdrew due to health reasons around August 2019 and Collins took over as the presidential nominee.  The party picked anti-alcohol activist Billy Joe Parker as Collins's new running mate.  Parker spoke to Wikinews back in July.


After securing the Prohibition Party presidential nomination, Collins sought the nominations of the American Independent Party (AIP) and the Reform Party for ballot access in California and Florida, respectively. Despite winning the AIP California Presidential Primary in March, Collins lost the nomination to businessman Rocky De La Fuente in August. He also fell short of De La Fuente for the Reform Party presidential nomination in June. Nevertheless, the Prohibition Party has attained ballot access in Colorado, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Vermont.  The last presidential election in which the party appeared on at least four state ballots was in 1984 with nominee Earl Dodge.


The Prohibition Party is the third oldest existing political party in the US, having been established in 1869. It reached its height of popularity during the late nineteenth century. As its name suggests, the party supported the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which banned the sale of alcohol, and resulted in the period known as Prohibition (1919–33).  Since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the party has declined.  It stays afloat, in part, due to the George L. Pennock Trust established in 1939, which pays the party's operating expenses.  It continues to nominate candidates for president as well.  Wikinews has previously interviewed two of those nominees: 2004 and 2008 presidential nominee Gene Amondson and 2016 presidential nominee James (Jim) Hedges.  Collins makes it three.


With Wikinews, Collins discusses his background, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on his campaign, presidential nominations, gridlock, climate change, foreign policy, and race relations.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Bill_Hammons,_Unity_Party_of_America_presidential_nominee",2020-10-23,"Wikinews interviews Bill Hammons, Unity Party of America presidential nominee","Wikinews accredited reporter William S. Saturn reached out to Unity Party of America presidential nominee Bill Hammons of Colorado to discuss Hammons's 2020 campaign for President of the United States.


Hammons, a former Newsweek manager and owner of the website ""Bill's List"", founded the Unity Party in 2004 with supporters of General Wesley Clark's unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. The party, which describes itself as centrist, advocates in its constitution for, among other things, a balanced budget amendment, elimination of the federal income tax, tax deduction for health care costs, a global minimum wage for fair trade, term limits for Congress and judges, lowering the voting age, DC statehood, and expanded space exploration.


Hammons has grown the party with various campaigns for public office.  He ran for US Congress in 2008 and 2010, US Senate in 2014 and 2016, and for Governor of Colorado in 2018.  Last year, Hammons embarked on a presidential campaign and became the Unity Party's first presidential nominee. Engineer Eric Bodenstab, the party's 2018 nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Colorado was picked to be his running mate. Bodenstab spoke to Wikinews last August. The Hammons-Bodenstab ticket has qualified for ballot access in Colorado, Louisiana, and New Jersey.


With Wikinews, Hammons discusses his background, campaign, the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Supreme Court, and Black Lives Matter, among other issues.

RIAA's DMCA notice alleged the script's purpose of existence was to ""circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorized streaming services such as YouTube"" and ""reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use"". 


youtube-dl has multiple unit tests in its source code, which test whether the software works in different circumstances or not.  Some of the tests include checking if the script can download Creative Commons licensed videos, videos which did not have square pixels, videos with no age restriction, ""offensive to some audiences"" per YouTube community and age-restricted videos.  One of the tests included the URL of some copyrighted songs.  Citing this test, RIAA's take-down notice claimed ""comments in the youtube-dl source code make clear that the source code was designed and is marketed for the purpose of circumventing YouTube's technological measures"".


RIAA's notice published by GitHub alleged violation of 17 U.S. Code § 1201 Circumvention of copyright protection systems which says ""No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title"".  RIAA listed a number of forks of youtube-dl and requested GitHub via the notice they all be made inaccessible.


The notice did not list any incident of anyone using youtube-dl to download or share copyrighted material, nor mention any damages that actually occurred.  Unremarked by the notice, YouTube allows videos to be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license.  When a copyright holder chooses to release their work, be it a photograph, a video, or audio, under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, they allow everyone to freely own, share or modify the work as long as the reusers properly attribute the author of the work.  YouTube also hosts many audio and video recordings in the public domain which can be used for any purpose without any restrictions.


youtube-dl is used by thousands of people around the world.  Multiple Creative Commons-licensed and public domain videos on Wikimedia Commons are uploaded via a tool called video2commons, which relies on youtube-dl to download media.  youtube-dl also lets users download videos from LiveLeak — a video-sharing platform for citizen journalism.  Videos downloaded using youtube-dl are also used for the purpose of fair use, or for evidence.


youtube-dl comes with a small JavaScript interpreter where it acts as a web-browser would behave while receiving video data from the server.  The script has ""extractors"" for various websites to handle videos from different sources.  Whenever something is displayed on the user's screen, the device has a copy of that content.  Web browsers ""download"" data while surfing the web, though most of it is not persistent on the device.  It is possible to download copyrighted photos by using a web-browser.  The way the world wide web works, there are no technological prevention measures to prevent recording and sharing of content such as RIAA talks about in the notice.  Photos and texts can be downloaded by taking screenshots, videos by screen recording tools, and audio by recording on a tape if not an audio recording software.


Multiple users expressed their disappointment on Twitter and Internet Relay Chat.  One of the users said ""this is yet another example of why we should use git as it was intended, as a distributed network, rather than rely on one single proprietary server"".  Git is decentralised version-tracking software which is used by a large number of software companies and projects.  It is possible to host one's own git server for software development.  While Microsoft's GitHub is a centralised git server, development of software using git does not require a GitHub account.


Soon after the public access to the repository was locked, multiple users started sharing the source code via self-hosted git servers, Tor sites and via the Torrent protocol leading to a Streisand effect.  Streisand effect is when a measure to censor information causes further spread of that information.  The binary files of the software are still available on its website for users to download.  Some people came up with esoteric ways to share the source code, by converting the compressed code into photographs and providing shell commands to convert to the source code.


GitHub's DMCA repository, where the takedown notice was published for public viewing, was subject to contant vandalism from multiple GitHub users.  One user submitted a pull request, merging the source code of youtube-dl along with the DMCA repository.  This enabled users to view youtube-dl's source code from within the DMCA repository, provided they know the commit id.


The Electronic Frontier Foundation said on Twitter ""Youtube-dl is a legitimate tool with a world of a lawful uses.  Demanding its removal from Github is a disappointing and counterproductive move by the RIAA.""  Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, has been highly critical of DRM (digital rights management, the subject of the DMCA) for many years now.


Wikinews reached out to Sergey M․, one of the maintainers of youtube-dl script, however Sergey said he ""won't give any comments at this time"".  Later, he shared an update on the IRC channel.  Sergey said, ""they require complete removal of so called YouTube's rolling cipher implementation [...] GitHub requires in order to reinstate the repo [...] under this conditions I could reinstate it in Saturday/Sunday already but this is an unsatisfactory outcome"".  He also said, ""I can't guarantee whether [or] not we will bend over them considering the situation with @phihag [Philipp Hagemeister] but we'll see soon what we can do in order to keep the max we have and mitigate potential legal issues at the same time"".


EFF is yet to respond to Wikinews queries.  Wikinews also reached out to Philipp Hagemeister, a former maintainer and contributor of the youtube-dl project to discuss this takedown.


When did you get to know about the takedown notice and what were your initial reactions?


((Philipp Hagemeister))  I saw the takedown notice along with anyone else, on reddit.  Since I am no longer involved with the youtube-dl project (except for occasional contributions, my maintainership ended in 2016), I don't know any details.


((RS))  Does YouTube implement DRM for videos not under Creative Commons license, and if so, how does youtube-dl bypass it?  Could you please elaborate the procedure?


((Philipp Hagemeister))  YouTube implements DRM for YouTube Movies.  youtube-dl does not support those.


YouTube has multiple non-DRM video delivery protocols.  I'm not up to date about specifics; my last dabbling in this was in 2015.


One of these protocols is described here.  YouTube uses JavaScript to compute parts of the URLs.  youtube-dl executes this JavaScript, just like a web browser.


((WN))  Could you also explain in brief how youtube-dl functions, and how the maintainers had intended it to be used?


((Philipp Hagemeister))  youtube-dl downloads and plays videos and music, just like any other web browser, from over 1000 different services. Its uses are varied: It enables video playback on many devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi) where the video services don't work properly, it makes high-quality video playable for people with a bad or no Internet connection, it enables disabled users to use tools to play videos, and it is used for archival and research.


((WN))  What do you think of the DMCA notice?


((Philipp Hagemeister))  I think it is not warranted because youtube-dl is entirely legal.  As the DMCA notice has no effect for me personally, I'm not really the right person to address it.


((WN))  Why were the copyrighted tests in the source code?  Could they be replaced?


((Philipp Hagemeister))  I'm not sure why, but my guess is that users requested support for these videos and thus they were added as test cases.  They can be removed trivially, without losing any function of youtube-dl.


((WN))  Are you aware Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was a ""disappointing and counterproductive move""?  What do you think should be the next steps?


((Philipp Hagemeister))  Yes, and I concur.  I'm no longer involved in the project. If I were, I would probably just remove the test cases, block these music videos (RIAA is not worth the trouble for me, that can be done by other projects), and get the project back online.
I understand people who think differently.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/On_the_campaign_trail_in_the_USA,_September_2020",2020-10-29,"On the campaign trail in the USA, September 2020","The following is the fifth edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.


This month's spotlight on the campaign trail: the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee secures ballot access in all 50 U.S. states, the Unity Party of America presidential nominee proposes a novel solution to the issue of ""packing"" the U.S. Supreme Court, and three candidates give their thoughts on the latest military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.


As the campaign entered September, Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden led President Donald Trump, the Republican Party presidential nominee, in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.0 percent to 43.0 percent.


President Trump started the month visiting Kenosha, Wisconsin, where riots had broken out due to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in August.  Trump referred to the riots as acts of ""domestic terror"" and placed further emphasis on maintaining ""law and order."" His opponent, Biden, in a message to fundraisers, accused Trump of ""trying to scare the hell out of America.""  Biden himself visited Kenosha two days after Trump in what was his first campaign trip to the swing state of Wisconsin.  During the appearance, Biden delivered a speech on racial inequality while wearing a mask, discussing the ""original sin"" of slavery.  He also visited the family of Jacob Blake and spoke to Blake on the phone.  The Trump campaign criticized Biden for not denouncing Antifa and for making the trip despite claiming previously that it was not safe to do so due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Wisconsin governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, said he would have preferred that neither Trump nor Biden had made the stop. At least three unfavorable claims about Trump surfaced in early September.  First, after CNN reporter and former Bill Clinton White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart questioned whether the President's impromptu visit to Walter Reed Hospital last November was the result of a stroke, Trump alleged the media was falsely claiming he had suffered from ""mini-strokes.""  Thereafter, Matt Drudge posted a report from The Hill about Trump's ""mini-strokes"" tweet as the top story on the Drudge Report. Trump attacked Drudge as a consistent Trump opponent and his campaign called for CNN to fire Lockhart.  Next, The Atlantic claimed that during a 2018 trip to France, Trump refused to visit a cemetery of U.S. soldiers killed during the World War I Battle of Belleau Wood and referred to the soldiers buried there as ""losers"" and ""suckers.""  Furthermore, Trump allegedly questioned whether the U.S. allied with the correct side during the war.  Aides publicly denied the story as did Trump-critic and former National Security Advisor John Bolton.  Nevertheless, others, including Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin, confirmed key parts of the story.  Trump called on Fox News to fire Griffin. Lastly, excerpts from Bob Woodward's book Rage, for which Trump gave insider access, revealed Trump downplayed the coronavirus in February in order to avoid public panic.  Trump confirmed the claim, arguing it was not in the national interest to stir up panic about the virus.   Biden, while campaigning in Michigan, called Trump's action ""a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.""  He described it as ""beyond despicable"" and ""almost criminal."" 
Trump stirred controversy for himself both during an interview with a local Wilmington, North Carolina outlet and again at a rally in Pennsylvania.  He suggested supporters fill out absentee ballots, and then visit their polling places and vote in-person if records indicated they had not voted. After Trump tweeted the same advice, Twitter placed a warning over the tweet. People in the Trump administration and campaign said his comments were misconstrued and that he did not support voting twice. According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, voting twice is a felony.


In mid-September, Trump held his first indoor rally in three months, in Nevada, flouting local coronavirus mandates.  Afterwards Trump visited California to discuss the wildfires wreaking havoc in the state.  In a public briefing that included California governor Gavin Newsom, Trump denied the effect of climate change on the intensity of the fires, arguing they were largely the product of forest mismanagement.  The climate change issue reappeared on the campaign trail.  Biden delivered a speech in Delaware in which he called Trump a ""climate arsonist,"" citing the recent California wildfires, flooding and Atlantic hurricanes.  He argued that if Trump wins re-election, ""these hellish events will continue to become more common."" In Florida, where hurricanes have a disproportionate impact, polls revealed Trump strengthening with Latinos; perhaps due, League of United Latin American Citizens president Domingo Garcia indicated, to Trump's social conservative positions and stances against socialism and protests.  As Kamala Harris visited the state and focused more on the African American constituency, Biden campaign officials expressed concern about Latino support.  Biden improved his standing among another large voting bloc in Florida, senior citizens, who voted heavily for Trump in 2016.  Furthermore, a major boost for Biden in Florida came with the announcement that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg planned to invest US$100 million into the state and offered to pay fines for former inmates to regain their ability to vote. Trump claimed the move was criminal. 


Building on the deal brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the previous month, the Trump administration announced additional deals between Israel and Bahrain and between Serbia, Kosovo, and Israel.  Like the UAE, the Muslim majority nations of Bahrain and Kosovo recognized Israel and opened diplomatic relations with the nation. The formerly antagonistic nations of Serbia and Kosovo opened economic ties as well and Serbia agreed to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Representatives from the UAE, Bahrain, and Israel held a special signing at the White House with President Trump.  Trump hailed the agreements as the ""dawn of a new Middle East.""  Meanwhile, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region escalated to violence. Back home, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, leaving an opening on the Court.  Democrats claimed the election should decide who picks the next justice, citing the Republicans' refusal to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland after the death of Antonin Scalia in 2016.  Republicans argued this was a different situation than in 2016 because now the party controlling the Senate matches the President's party.  President Trump nominated Federal Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the seat.  Citing concerns Barrett's placement would upset the balance of the Court for conservatives, some Democrats advocated packing the Court with liberal justices until it reached a liberal majority.  That would only be possible if Democrats won the presidency and the Senate.  When confronted with the possibility of Democrats winning the election, Trump would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power, claiming the possibility of fraud occurring as a result of increased mail-in voting. Trump received criticism for the statement.  Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a sometime Trump critic, said the peaceful transfer of power is what separates the U.S. from nations like Belarus, and described Trump's potential unwillingness as ""unthinkable and unacceptable."" The Biden campaign recycled a statement it first put out in July:  ""The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House."" Trump received further criticism just ahead of the first presidential debate,  when The New York Times published allegations about his tax returns.  The reports indicated Trump paid US$750 in taxes in 2016 and the same amount in 2017, and that he owed on loans in excess of US$300 million due in four years.  Trump labeled the report as ""fake news"" and said he would release his tax returns once he was no longer under audit.  Biden left the campaign trail a few days before the debate to prepare both virtually and in-person at his Delaware house. According to CNN, a source told them Trump prepared for a total of two hours, enlisting help from former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  He continued to hold campaign rallies and White House events.


The first presidential debate between Trump and Biden took place on the penultimate day of September in Ohio. During the debate, the candidates often interrupted each other.  Although Biden was the first to do so, Trump interrupted far more often.  Moderator Chris Wallace was criticized for his inability to maintain control. During the debate, Biden would not say whether or not he supported Court packing.  Once, when Trump interjected, Biden said ""Will you Shut up, man?""  During the course of the debate, Biden called Trump a clown, a racist, and the worst president.  Trump insulted Biden as unintelligent. After Biden attacked Trump for the alleged ""losers"" and ""suckers"" comment reported in The Atlantic, Trump brought up Biden's son Hunter Biden and his dealings in Ukraine and China.  Biden defended his son's struggle with drugs. Biden attacked Trump for the over 200,000 U.S. deaths from coronavirus. Trump countered that Biden would have lost even more if he were president due to his opposition to the travel ban from China. Trump claimed Democrats pushed Biden to the far left on socialized medicine, the Green New Deal and defunding the Police. Biden referred to himself as the Democratic Party and said he did not support the policies Trump mentioned. Trump argued Biden had just lost the far left by saying he didn't support those things.  He challenged Biden to name any law enforcement individuals or groups who endorsed Biden's campaign, which Biden did not do. Trump made a confusing statement about the far right organization Proud Boys, when asked to condemn them, stating ""stand back and stand by"" but argued the far left Antifa organization needed to be addressed.  Biden called Antifa an ""idea.""  Trump continued his claims about postal voting causing fraud and again would not commit to accepting the results of the election. After the debate, CNN anchor Dana Bash described the event as a ""shitshow."" Republican Senator Ben Sasse had the same response. Fox News commentator Ari Fleischer called it ""a mess.""  Biden called Trump a ""national embarrassment"" for his performance, while the communications director for the Trump campaign, Tim Murtaugh, declared victory for Trump.  According to the Commission on Presidential Debates, moderators would have ""additional tools"" to maintain order in future debates.


As September came to a close, Biden maintained his lead over President Trump in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.7 percent to 43.1 percent.


Libertarian Party presidential candidate Jo Jorgensen passed a milestone in September, becoming the only third party candidate in this election to secure ballot access in all states and the District of Columbia.  The party had the same access in 2016, but in that cycle there was no coronavirus pandemic hampering petitioning efforts.  Before 2016, the last time the Libertarian Party had ballot access in all jurisdictions was 1996 when Jorgensen was on the ballot as the running mate of the late Harry Browne.  The Browne-Jorgensen ticket, as well as the Reform Party ticket of the late Ross Perot that same year, was the last time before 2016 that any third party or independent candidate achieved full ballot access.


In a celebratory email to supporters, Jorgensen exclaimed: ""It's official — my campaign is on ballot in ALL 50 states!  I want to thank all the volunteers and staff who made this possible. It was a lot of work! We're talking about hours upon hours of collecting petitions.""


With the access secured, Jorgensen aimed to gain entry to the presidential debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.  The Commission's  criterion for inclusion remains a showing of 15 percent support in opinion polls.  In late September polls, when included, Jorgensen was in third place.  She drew two percent in the September 25–27 Léger poll, two percent in the September 26–27 Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey, and five percent in the September 25–27 Zogby Analytics poll.


""We are the real choice for American voters in November,"" Jorgensen argued, ""yet the corrupt Commission on Presidential Debates refuses to have me. Our campaign is the only viable option to both Trump or Biden.""


In 2016, despite full ballot access and a lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates, then-Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson was denied access to the debates.  Nevertheless, he received 3.27 percent of the vote on Election Day, the most a Libertarian Party presidential nominee has ever received.

In mid-September, staunch liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died after a long battle with cancer.  President Trump nominated conservative Amy Coney Barrett as her replacement.  With a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate, Barrett's confirmation was likely, resulting a 6–3 majority for conservatives in the Court.  In response, some Democrats, such as former 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, proposed major changes to the Court, similar to what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed in the 1930s.  While Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden did not say in the debate whether he supports significant changes, one third party presidential nominee proposed to Wikinews a novel approach, aiming both to prevent future Court packing and promote ideological balance.


After his New Deal programs suffered a series of defeats in the Supreme Court, President Roosevelt looked to add justices that would interpret the Constitution to uphold his agenda.  Capitalizing on the public perception of the Court as being too old, Roosevelt sought to tie the number of justices to age. In 1937, he proposed a bill to amend the Judiciary Act of 1869, which sets the number of Supreme Court justices at nine.
Roosevelt's bill would allow the President to nominate one additional justice for every justice over the age of 70 years and six months with at least ten years of experience on the bench.  The proposal capped the number of justices to be nominated this way at six.  The plan did not receive much support, even from his own Democratic Party.  The Senate voted 70 to 20 to send the bill back to committee, where it died.


Now, 83 years later, some Democrats have revisited a plan to expand the number of justices that Buttigieg proposed during his campaign.  He suggested expanding the Court to 15 justices: five Republicans, five Democrats, and five to be chosen by the other justices. Other Democratic plans include a straight-up expansion of the number of justices and a plan to institute term limits for justices.  According to a 2019 Marquette University poll, 57 percent of the U.S. public opposes expanding the number of justices. However, 72 percent support term limits.


Bill Hammons, 2020 presidential nominee of the Unity Party of America, whose running mate Eric Bodenstab spoke to Wikinews in August, provided Wikinews with his own plan for the Court.  While it would expand the number of justices, it aims to prevent future Court packing:


""The number of Justices should be set at 13 with a Constitutional Amendment to prevent future Court Packing,"" says Hammons, ""and the four new Justices should be smart non-ideologues who have been ignored for their lack of ideology.""


The U.S. Constitution provides two ways to propose a Constitutional Amendment as Hammons proposes: (1) a two-thirds affirmative vote in the Senate and House of Representatives, or (2) an affirmative vote in the state legislatures of two-thirds of the states to call a constitutional convention.  The latter route has not yet been used. If an amendment is successfully proposed, three-quarters of states must then ratify it in order for the amendment to become part of the Constitution.  The last successful amendment occurred in 1992.


While both the Hammons plan and the Buttigieg plan aim for balance, Hammons's approach differs from Buttigieg's in that future Court packing, like that proposed from President Roosevelt, would not be possible absent further amendment to the Constitution.  Furthermore, there is no partisan classification of justices provided and party identification does not serve as the basis for judicial ideology. Curiously, the number of justices Hammons favors matches the current number of U.S. circuit courts; the courts from which the Supreme Court hears appeals.


A longstanding conflict between the nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan erupted into violence late in September.  The conflict between the two Post-Soviet states centers on the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  It lies within the internationally-recognized borders of Azerbaijan but the Armenian-backed separatist Republic of Artsakh currently occupies it. After inquiry from Wikinews, U.S. presidential candidates Phil Collins of the Prohibition Party, Don Blankenship of the Constitution Party, and Jo Jorgensen of the Libertarian Party, weighed in on the issue.


██ Territory controlled by the Republic of Artsakh including Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh

██ Territory claimed by the Republic of Artsakh but controlled by Azerbaijan

██ Territory captured by Azerbaijan

Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a war over the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 1994.   Russia brokered a cease-fire agreement but skirmishes continued to break out.  The latest violence began with conflicting claims from both sides. The Armenians claim they were retaliating against missile attacks from Azerbaijan.  The Azerbaijanis state they were responding to Armenian aggression.  The president of Turkey vowed support for Azerbaijan, while Russia called for a cessation of fighting.  As of September 30, Armenia claimed 790 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed, with 103 Artsakh deaths. Azerbaijan claimed to have killed about 2,300 Artsakh soldiers.


President Trump commented on the matter during a White House Press Briefing, ""[W]e're looking at it very strongly. [...] We have a lot of good relationships in that area. We'll see if we can stop it.""  Although Trump's State Department asked for any ""external party"" not to involve themselves in the conflict, his main presidential rival Joe Biden called on the President to demand directly that Turkey stop interfering on Azerbaijan's behalf.


Collins saw compromise as the best way for the two nations to resolve their differences: ""I think that those countries should compromise and split the disputed area in half."" Nevertheless, Collins did not want the U.S. to involve itself militarily and calls on Washington to remain neutral. His opponents, Jorgensen and Blankenship, shared this view.


""The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan is their conflict. Not ours"", said Jorgensen. ""We have no business taking either side. Our foreign policy should resemble one giant Switzerland, armed and neutral.""


Blankenship concurred: ""We need to stop policing the world and allow other countries to manage their own affairs"", he argued. ""We need to withdraw our troops from all but a very few foreign countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan should be given the freedom to solve their own issues. "" 


There is precedent for the U.S. President mediating international disputes. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt mediated a peace agreement between Japan and Russia, fostering the treaty that ended the Russo-Japanese War.  Roosevelt's efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize.  President Jimmy Carter mediated an end to the conflict between Israel and Egypt at the Camp David Accords in 1978 that brought about the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty and the normalization of relations between the two nations.  The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited this in awarding Carter the 2002 Peace Prize.  And President Trump, in September 2020, addressed the Arab–Israeli conflict in mediating the Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Jo_Jorgensen,_U.S._Libertarian_Party_presidential_nominee",2020-10-29,"Wikinews interviews Jo Jorgensen, U.S. Libertarian Party presidential nominee","Professor Jo Jorgensen of South Carolina, the U.S. Libertarian Party's 2020 presidential nominee, answered some questions about her campaign from Wikinews accredited reporter William S. Saturn.


Jorgensen is a psychology professor at Clemson University.   In 1992, with the Libertarian Party's backing, she ran for public office, seeking South Carolina's 4th congressional seat in the United States House of Representatives.  She finished the race in third place with almost 2.16 percent of the total vote. Four years later, the Libertarian Party tapped Jorgensen to be its vice presidential nominee.  She joined a ticket with the late Harry Browne.  Browne-Jorgensen appeared on every state ballot and received a total of 485,798 votes, which was roughly 0.5 percent. This marked the best performance for the party since 1980 and would not be topped percentage-wise until 2012 when former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson attained 0.99 percent of the vote.  Johnson bested that performance in 2016 as the party's presidential nominee for a second time, earning 3.27 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for the party  since its 1971 inception.


For the 2020 nomination, Jorgensen navigated through a primary campaign that featured the short-lived campaigns of former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee and Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan, the first sitting Congressman to be a member of the Libertarian Party.  At the virtual 2020 Libertarian National Convention, Jorgensen won the nomination on the fourth ballot, edging attorney Jacob Hornberger, performance artist Vermin Supreme and activist Adam Kokesh, among others.  Podcaster Spike Cohen, originally the running mate of Supreme, was picked to be the party's vice presidential nominee.  Cohen spoke to Wikinews back in June.  The Jorgensen-Cohen ticket has since secured ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.


As a libertarian, an ideology that advocates for lesser government, both in the social and economic realms, Jorgensen's issue positions include a mix of traditionally liberal and conservative stances.  She supports both LGBT rights and gun rights.  She opposes the police state and the taxing authority equally.  And, she supports an open immigration policy while arguing against the welfare state. 


With Wikinews, Jorgensen discusses her background, COVID-19, her potential cabinet, gridlock, and an assortment of issues including climate change, foreign affairs, free speech, and race relations. 


((WSS)) : Which past U.S. president(s) do you most admire and why? 


((WSS)) : How have your past experiences prepared you for the job of President?


((WSS)) : How would you describe your style of leadership?  How does it compare to the leadership styles of President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama?   


((WSS)) : If you were president, how would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently than President Trump?


((WSS)) : How has the pandemic affected your campaign and your ability to reach out to voters?

((WSS)) : In 2016, Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson, the former Governor of New Mexico, received about 3.28 percent of the popular vote, a record for the party.  Based on your polling and general feeling on the ground, what percentage of the popular vote do you expect to receive in the 2020 election?


((WSS)) : During the 2016 campaign, Gary Johnson responded to a reporter's question about the Syrian city of Aleppo with ""What is Aleppo?""  This seems to be one thing people most remember about Johnson.  If there's one thing the public will remember about you and your campaign, what do you want it to be?  What do you expect it to be?


((WSS)) : What would a Jorgensen administration look like?  Which specific individuals would you ask to be in your cabinet?


((WSS)) : There is currently only one Libertarian in Congress, Justin Amash.  He is not seeking re-election.  If you win the election, the government will remain divided.  How will you work with Congress to avoid gridlock and pass your agenda?

((WSS)) : What are your views on the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan?  What would you do as president to help resolve the conflict and how does that comport with your overarching philosophy on foreign affairs?


((WSS)) : Are you concerned about the deplatforming and social media censorship of notable conservatives and libertarians?  How would you address this issue as president?

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Brian_Carroll,_American_Solidarity_Party_presidential_nominee",2020-10-30,"Wikinews interviews Brian Carroll, American Solidarity Party presidential nominee","Retired teacher Brian T. Carroll, the presidential nominee of the American Solidarity Party, answered some questions about his campaign from Wikinews accredited reporter William S. Saturn.


Carroll is an Evangelical Christian. During a 44 year career in education, he mainly taught history to middle school children in California.  He spent nine years in Colombia teaching children whose missionary parents were stationed there. Carroll joined the Solidarity Party and ran for Congress in 2018 for California's 22nd congressional seat.  He finished the nonpartisan blanket primary in fifth with 1.3 percent of the vote. Carroll received the Solidarity Party's 2020 presidential nomination in September 2019 over two other contenders: candidate Joshua Perkins and past Wikinews interviewee Joe Schriner.  Carroll selected fellow teacher Amar Patel as his running mate.  Patel spoke to Wikinews in August.


The Solidarity Party was founded in 2011 as the Christian Democratic Party. It is based on Roman Catholic social teachings, advocating for social justice, environmentalism, and ""a consistent life ethic"" including opposition to abortion, euthanasia, and capital punishment.  The party changed to its current name ahead of the 2016 presidential election, when its first ticket of Mike Maturen for president and Juan Muñoz for vice president appeared on the ballot only in Colorado, receiving reportedly a total of 6,777 votes, largely from write-ins elsewhere.  It has grown ahead of the 2020 presidential election, securing ballot access for the Carroll–Patel ticket in a total of eight states, with write-in access in 23 others.


With Wikinews, Carroll discusses his background, COVID-19 and campaigning, presidential nominations, and his views on such issues as climate change, foreign policy, internet speech, and race relations in the United States.

"https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/On_the_campaign_trail_in_the_USA,_October_2020",2020-11-02,"On the campaign trail in the USA, October 2020","The following is the sixth and final edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.


This month's spotlight on the campaign trail: the Free and Equal Elections Foundation holds two presidential debates, three candidates who did not participate in those debates give their final pleas to voters, and three political pundits give their predictions on the outcome of the election.


Polls at the start of the final full month on the campaign trail showed Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump, the Republican Party presidential nominee, in the RealClearPolitics average, 50.1 to 42.9 percent.


October started with a surprise for the electorate. After it was revealed his aide Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus, President Trump himself, his wife Melania, and son Barron all tested positive for the virus. Trump was said to be suffering ""minor symptoms"", and was admitted to Walter Reed Hospital as a precaution.  Video captured Trump wearing a mask while walking to Marine One en route to the hospital. Doctors reportedly treated the president with a cocktail of medicines that included an experimental drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as well as the anti-viral remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.  His condition was said to be improving and he posted a four minute long video from the hospital. Supporters gathered outside and Trump made a much-criticized ride to wave at them from the presidential limousine.  After a three day stay, Trump was released from the hospital and returned to the White House.  He tweeted, ""Don't be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life."" A couple days after Trump’s release, the only vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris took place in Utah, moderated by USA Today Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page.  Pence often spoke over his allotted time and interjected.  In one exchange, as Pence attempted to interrupt, Harris exclaimed, ""Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking."" A fly landed on Pence's hair for about two minutes. Page received criticism for not asking follow-up questions.  Politico regarded the debate as ""markedly more civil"" than the prior Trump-Biden debate.  The next day, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced its second official presidential debate between Trump and Biden would be virtual due to President Trump's positive COVID-19 test. Trump declined such an arrangement and the Commission canceled the debate.  In its place, Biden scheduled a town hall to air on ABC.  Trump later scheduled a competing town hall on NBC.


With the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett looming, the issue of Court packing returned.  Biden and Harris both refused to answer whether they would support Court packing.  Biden said voters ""don't deserve"" to know his position.  A few days later, Biden made another frank comment when he claimed 56 percent of respondents to a Gallup poll, who regarded their personal situation as better now than four years ago, were not remembering correctly, adding people should vote, whatever their beliefs. Still recovering from coronavirus, Trump gave his first speech since the diagnosis from the White House balcony.  Trump's doctors said the President no longer posed a risk of spreading the virus.  Two days later, he returned to the campaign trail with a rally in Sanford, Florida.  At the rally, Trump declared himself ""immune"" and offered to kiss members of the crowd.  White House doctors said Trump tested negative for COVID-19 for two consecutive days.


In another potential ""October surprise,"" on the week of Trump and Biden's dueling town halls, the New York Post published an article about the discovery of a laptop belonging to Biden's son Hunter that he allegedly abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop.  According to the Post, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon told them of its existence and current Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City, recently gave them a copy of its harddrive's contents allegedly obtained from the shop owner.  E-mails in the copy detailed Hunter's worldwide business affairs and alleged influence peddling.  Contrary to the elder Biden's assurances he had no involvement in his son's business deals, an e-mail alluded to a 2015 meeting between the elder Biden and a Ukranian adviser to the board of the energy company Burisma, on which Hunter served. The report claimed after the meeting the elder Biden used his influence as vice president to have a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma fired.  The material also contained a video of Hunter smoking crack cocaine and taking part in a sex act.  Fifty former intelligence officials, including former CIA directors John Brennan, Leon Panetta, and Michael Hayden, signed a letter saying the Post'‍s report ""has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.""  Current Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said the information was ""not part of some Russian disinformation campaign."" According to The Washington Post, intelligence officials warned the administration last December that Giuliani could be a conduit for Russian disinformation. Twitter prevented users from sharing the Post story, claiming it violated their policy on hacked materials.  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey later said they made a mistake. Facebook did not censor the story but limited its spread on their platform.  Shortly after the report, Trump and Biden held the dueling town halls on NBC and ABC, respectively.  While NBC simulcast Trump's hour long town hall, hosted by Savannah Guthrie, on the main network as well as MSNBC and CNBC, ABC broadcast Biden's town hall with George Stephanopoulos for two hours.  The broadcast of Biden's event received more viewers than Trump's event. At his town hall, which newspaper The Hill described as combative, Trump refused to disavow the Qanon conspiracy theory and defended his pandemic policies.  At Biden's event, Biden implied he would consider making a potential COVID-19 vaccine mandatory.  On Court packing, he said his decision would depend on how the Senate conducts the Barrett confirmation hearing.


The Commission on Presidential Debates announced the moderator for the third debate would have a mute button to prevent interruptions during the first two minute candidate responses with each question.  Biden left the campaign trail to prepare for the debate.  Trump did minimal preparation, holding rallies instead.  At this time, he made critical remarks about National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci and posted footage on Twitter from a soon-to-be released 60 Minutes interview with Leslie Stahl, that Trump claimed was unfair.  Trump's previous debate prepper Giuliani received further media scrutiny when he appeared in the Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.  In a scene, Giuliani goes into a hotel bedroom, where a hidden camera records him lying on a bed with his hands in his pants in the company of a young actress posing as a conservative journalist. Giuliani claimed he was tucking in his shirt after removing his microphone and suggested Borat actor and producer Sacha Baron Cohen may have deceptively edited the footage. Giuliani received news concerning the laptop harddrive data in his possession: Fox News reported two separate law enforcement sources confirmed an FBI money laundering probe connected to the laptop.  Additionally, Ratcliffe and FBI director Christopher Wray held a press conference discussing concerns about Iranian and Russian interference in the election.  Ratcliffe claimed Iran spoofed e-mails to spread false information about voting to hurt President Trump's chances of re-election.  Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon predicted Trump would run for president again in 2024 if he lost in 2020.  Democrats continued to attack Trump on his taxes. Senator Bernie Sanders slammed Trump for a New York Times story alleging Trump paid more taxes to the Chinese and other governments than to the United States.  


Just before the final presidential debate, Hunter Biden's former business partner Tony Bobulinski held a press conference claiming Joe Biden knew about his son's business deals, particularly with China, and that the elder Biden was involved with them.  He claimed to have evidence supporting the claim. The issue came up at the Nashville, Tennessee-set second presidential debate, moderated by Kristen Welker of NBC News.  Biden denied the allegations, labeled them as Russian disinformation.  Echoing an email from Hunter Biden's laptop referencing a mysterious ""big guy"" who received a cut of money, Trump said, ""You're the big man, I think.""  Trump attacked Biden for accumulating wealth since leaving public office, accusing the Biden family of going around the world and sucking up money like a vacuum.  Biden slammed Trump, viewing the president as having no plan to combat COVID-19.  Trump said he banned travel from China in January, which Biden opposed as xenophobic.  He claimed a vaccine was near and said people are ""learning to live"" with the virus.  Biden countered that people are instead ""learning to die"" with it. Biden argued that Trump had no healthcare plan.  He proposed a public option and claimed nobody lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare.  Trump alleged Biden's plan would strip Medicare and Social Security.  He vowed to protect people with pre-existing conditions from being denied health coverage. When asked about climate change, Trump claimed carbon emissions have been lower during his administration and argued against re-entering the Paris Climate Accord. Biden argued that green energy can provide good paying jobs. Trump accused Biden of previously saying he wanted to ban hydraulic fracturing. Biden denied, though Trump said it is on tape.  Biden asked Trump to post the video on his website.  Welker brought up the separation of immigrant families at the border.  Trump point out the Obama administration constructed the cages seen in widely circulated photos taken in 2014. Trump blasted Biden as a career politician and repeatedly asked why Biden did not already implement the policies he proposed. Biden attacked Trump on paying fewer taxes to which Trump claimed he prepaid ""millions of dollars"" in taxes. Trump cornered Biden on oil and gas when Biden admitted wanting to phase out the industry. Trump said Biden just lost Texas, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Ohio as a consequence.  Welker received near-universal praise for her performance.  Observers noted the debate was more orderly than the first.


In the final days of October, Trump ramped up his campaign, holding up to five rallies a day  throughout such states as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Arizona, and Florida, among others. Biden limited campaigning but still made stops in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, and others.  Due to COVID-19, attendees to Biden events were required to socially distance or to stay in their automobiles with horns in the place of applause.  At one Biden rally in Pennsylvania, Trump supporters audibly chanted slogans nearby.  Biden referred to the people as ""chumps.""  At another in Minnesota, Biden referred to hecklers as ""ugly folks.""  Meanwhile, a series of news events broke as Election Day drew closer.  The Senate confirmed judge Barrett to the Supreme Court.  Justice Clarence Thomas swore her in at a White House ceremony with Trump looking on.  The White House also announced a deal it brokered to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel.  This followed deals the administration brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kosovo, in recent months.  The fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., a mentally ill African American man armed with a knife, sparked riots and looting in Philadelphia. Biden-Harris released a statement: ""[w]e cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death.""  President Trump called it a ""terrible event"" but urged for the National Guard to be brought in to end the violence.  Category Two Hurricane Zeta slammed into the Louisiana coast.  Winds from the storm delayed a rally Trump planned for North Carolina.  The anonymous insider who wrote New York Times op-eds and a book critical of the Trump administration was revealed to be former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor.  The Trump campaign described Taylor as ""just another standard-issue arrogant, Washington, DC swamp bro who loved President Trump until he figured out he could try to make money by attacking him"". The Commerce department released a report showing growth in GDP of 33.1 percent in the third quarter of 2020.  This was the largest growth for the nation in a quarter since World War II, topping the record of 16.7 percent in the first quarter of 1950.  Trump hailed the report on Twitter and warned that Biden could destroy the growth with his proposed tax increases.  Biden described the growth as not ""nearly enough.""


At the end of October, President Trump trailed former Vice President Biden in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head matchup, 51.3 to 43.5 percent.


The Free and Equal Elections Foundation held two debates in October, attracting third party and independent candidates.  The criterion for inclusion was ballot access in at least eight states.  The two major party candidates qualified but were barred from participating due to the contracts they signed with the Commission on Presidential Debates.   Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente, and rapper Kanye West were each invited but did not attend.  Those who did take part in-person were: Independent presidential candidate Brock Pierce, Green Party presidential nominee Howie Hawkins, Constitution Party presidential nominee Don Blankenship, American Solidarity Party presidential nominee Brian Carroll, and Party for Socialism and Liberation presidential nominee Gloria La Riva.  All of these candidates also confirmed for the final debate, but Blankenship ultimately decided not to attend. Free and Equal Elections Foundation founder and director Christina Tobin moderated both debates. This was the fourth election cycle the foundation has held a debate.  The debates used the format the League of Women voters developed when  they held the official presidential debates before the creation of the Commission on Presidential Debates.


At the initial debate, held October 8 in Denver, Colorado, after opening statements, the candidates received a total of 13 questions on the War in Afghanistan, approval and rank choice voting, national debate reform, the surveillance state, space warfare, indigenous rights, police reform, education reform, Yemen, the War on Drugs, vaccinations, gun rights, and excessive imprisonment. Questioners included Tobin, anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, Aaron Hamlin of The Center for Election Science, Eli Beckerman of Open the Debates, actor Sean Stone, SpaceX co-founder Jim Cantrell, indigenous leader Doug Good Feather, and the mother of prisoner  Ross Ulbricht.  The debate closed with final statements from each candidate.


In opening the debate, Carroll introduced himself as ""pro-life"" and said climate change must be addressed.  Pierce derided the two party system and argued it cannot resolve the nation's problems. La Riva blamed capitalism as the root of all the nation's ills.  Blankenship offered US$1 million to Hunter Biden to have a debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and made the same offer available to President Donald Trump. And Hawkins, the only candidate wearing a facemask, endorsed the Green New Deal and the Economic Bill of Rights.  


The candidates agreed on many issues with varied nuances. All supported the removal of US troops from Afghanistan though Pierce and Carroll raised concerns about the problems that  could arise from a hasty withdrawal.  While La Riva and Hawkins attacked war as a tool of the US ruling class, Blankenship wanted the US to avoid being the policeman of the world.  Blankenship described efforts toward approval or rank choice voting as too complicated and ""diluting"" efforts toward ballot access. All the other candidates favored rank choice voting.  La Riva favored offering voting rights to documented and undocumented immigrants, prisoners, and youths aged 16 to 18 years.  Most candidates felt the League of Women Voters did a better job holding debates than the Commission on Presidential Debates, agreeing the sponsor should be nonpartisan. Pierce commented on the unfairness of ""rigged polls"" excluding third party candidates. Blankenship attacked the media for maintaining the status quo, providing an example of the media falsely describing him as a ""felon"" ahead of the 2018 West Virginia Republican Senate primary. Blankenship favored expanding space exploration, arguing the US should be at the lead rather than some other nation. La Riva criticized any space agency as militaristic.  Most candidates agreed to the need of an international body to regulate space. On Police reform, Blankenship and Carroll expressed opposition to Defund the Police while La Riva fully endorsed it, Hawkins expressed an interest in community control of the police, and Pierce focused on providing further training for officers.  Pierce and Carroll endorsed charter schools, though Carroll expressed concerns about for-profit schools. Hawkins said many charter schools were scams.  La Riva said she fully opposed charter schools. Pierce called for an end to the War on Drugs, with which Hawkins and La Riva somewhat agreed. La Riva agreed and favored prosecuting banks for providing funds and said legalization would not be helpful, cautioning about the dangers of pharmaceuticals.  Hawkins called for the decriminalization of drugs like Portugal but felt those exploiting others should be prosecuted. He favored providing medical access for addicts.  Blankenship opposed ending the War on Drugs but said those at the top should be prosecuting rather than users.  Carroll agreed and cautioned about the effect of cannabis use on the brain. La Riva, Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all agreed that vaccines have done more good than harm.  Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all argued they should not be mandatory. Pierce said he would not take a vaccine for COVID-19, claiming it alters the recipient's RNA and turns them into ""genetically modified humans.""  Carroll and La Riva disagreed about whether a clinic in San Francisco was selling the body parts of aborted fetuses.  La Riva said she fully supports abortion rights.  On the issue of guns, Pierce expressed concern about the number of US citizens purchasing guns and warned of an impending civil war.


In closing, Pierce urged voters to ""vote their conscience."" La Riva argued that only socialism can bring about equality to the nation.  Blankenship claimed he was the only candidate on the stage who based his platform on the US Constitution and called for the use of cost-benefit analysis for policy.  Hawkins predicted President Trump would lose in a massive landslide and asked voters to vote for what they truly believe. Carroll demanded the protection of human dignity and support for the family as society's basic unit.


At the final debate held October 24 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, after opening statements, the candidates received ten questions on fairness in debates, veteran suicides, military propaganda, centralized control of technology, national sovereignty, the primary system, rank choice voting, ballot access laws, regulation of artificial intelligence, and the national debt. Chad  Peace of the Independent Voters Network, antiwar activist Adam Kokesh, Brian Anderson of Nexus, conspiracy theorist G. Edward Griffin, Kaia Los Huertos of the National Association of Nonpartisan Reformers, Renaldo Pearson of RepresentUS, Richard Winger of Ballot Access News, and Tobin, each asked questions. Like the previous, the debate concluded with final statements from the candidates.


With Blankenship's absence, only four candidates took the stage.  In opening, La Riva called for an end to the capitalist system, and the cancellation of all rents and mortgages.  Pierce professed himself ""deeply concerned"" about the future of the US and endorsed using ""life"", ""liberty"", and ""happiness"" as the measure of success.  Hawkins renewed his support for the Green New Deal and an Economic Bill of Rights, and added a call for the abolition of nuclear weapons.  He noted that the doomsday clock is very close to midnight. Carroll argued that the US has the strength necessary to overcome all the problems it faces.  He found it curious he was called a ""Democratic socialist"" in one publication and yet received the endorsement of a writer for The American Conservative.


Like the previous debate, there was much agreement among the candidates. Pierce and Hawkins both argued for using ballot access as an inclusion standard for debates.  La Riva disagreed, stating that the Electoral College should be eliminated. She criticized the Top Two election policy in California and called for the Citizens United decision to be overturned. Carroll also backed the overturn of Citizens United.  Hawkins attacked the ""macho culture"" that idolizes the military while it fights to protect the interests of the upper class. Carroll recalled someone who went to fight in the Vietnam War and returned changed. He wondered how the US can train people to be racist killers and then expect them to return to society. La Riva described the military as a ""horrible"" use of the working class.  She called the Korean War a ""genocidal war.""  Pierce then explained he was an honorary ambassador in Korea.  He longed for the reopening of the border between North and South Korea.  Pierce emphasized big tech censorship as a problem more than military propaganda. He argued that tech companies should either decide to be publishers or platforms. La Riva regarded technology under capitalism as problematic but said it would be beneficial under socialism. Pierce countered that technology is amoral and can be good or bad based on how it is used.  Hawkins argued that big tech is moving the nation in a democratic socialist direction.  Carroll argued for checks and balances for big tech and for a new level of government to regulate big tech.  La Riva then called for the expropriation of big tech companies and to let the US people decide how to use the parts.  Concerning national sovereignty, Pierce said he favored treaties over war and endorsed an audit of the Federal Reserve.  Hawkins called for the nationalization of the Federal Reserve and expressed concern about the nation losing its sovereignty to corporations rather than other nations. La Riva agreed with the nationalization of the Federal Reserve.  Carroll argued that trade deals like NAFTA have unforeseen consequences like pushing Mexican corn growers north of the border. Carroll also said he wanted to edit the 14th Amendment to remove corporations from its protection.  Whereas Pierce and Hawkins all felt parties should decide the procedures for their own primaries, La Riva favored the open primary system, arguing it is more democratic than Top Two.  Pierce claimed Abraham Lincoln was the last third party candidate to be elected president and that he appointed a cabinet of rivals.  Pierce said he was embarrassed about the questions politicians asked to tech leaders, and argued the nation needs ""visionary leadership.""  La Riva argued against Universal Basic Income (UBI), proposing minimum wage be increased to US$20 an hour.  Carroll agreed with La Riva, saying that jobs are more important than UBI.  He named his economic view as distributism, which he said was an extreme form of capitalism.  Hawkins claimed that as a currency issuers rather than a currency user, the US government has enough money to spend and that the debt and deficit does not matter. La Riva agreed, claiming there was enough wealth in the nation to pay for everyone's needs. Carroll called on the US to end its involvement in foreign wars worldwide and to stop paying for wars on a credit card.  Pierce viewed the debt as an issue and that government has run out of control and tax reform is necessary.


In conclusion, Carroll explained that he is pro-life on all issues. He supported social justice and considered strong local  communities, strong small businesses, and strong families as fundamental. La Riva argued socialism is growing in popularity and private ownership is the real tyranny people live under.  Pierce emphasized the need for education across the nation and likened the current system to indoctrination.  Hawkins claimed the coronavirus pandemic shows the US is a ""failed state.""  He urged voters to vote for what they want.


Wikinews provided an opportunity for three presidential candidates who did not participate in either of the Free and Equal Election debates to give their final plea to voters.  Those giving their final pleas are: Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, Prohibition Party presidential nominee Phil Collins, and Unity Party of America presidential nominee Bill Hammons.


Jo JorgensenImage: Jo Jorgensen for President.


Phil CollinsImage: Prohibition Party.


Bill HammonsImage: Bill Hammons.


I'm counting on my libertarian and independent base because they know that I'm the real deal. 


To dissatisfied Democrats stuck with a candidate who voted for more war and who wrote some of our most oppressive criminal justice laws, I say, ""There is a real party of peace and justice."" The party that selects the author of draconian incarceration and a prosecutor who locked up thousands for victimless crime does not deserve your vote. To them, I say, ""Be Bold. Vote Gold.""


To small-government Republicans who've watched out-of-control spending and fiat money creation, who rightly fear Venezuela-style inflation and economic collapse, I say, ""There is a real party of smaller government and individual responsibility."" We can unshackle the market to create prosperity and opportunity, and we can reduce government by 75% without leaving anyone out in the cold. To fiscal conservatives, I say, ""Be Bold. Vote Gold.""

My final plea is telling voters that I remind people about the harmful effects of alcohol.  I tell them that we care about other issues.  We support a balanced budget.  We're pro-life and pro-gun rights.

It is highly possible that this election will be the first to be thrown to the House of Representatives in the modern era.  The 12th Amendment outlines that the top three finishers in the Electoral College receive consideration for a House vote, and I would just need a handful of (or perhaps even just one) Electoral Vote(s) to be in the final running alongside two men who, not to put too fine a point on it, are walking National Security risks considering their health, age, and risk factors for a raging COVID-19 Pandemic.  I ask voters to vote their conscience, because Presidential Electors are people too, and enough Hammons votes might convince enough Electors to also vote their conscience.

Wikinews asked three political pundits to give their predictions for the Electoral college tally of the 2020 presidential election.  The pundits were: former U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo, who represented Colorado's 6th congressional district as a Republican; political blogger Thomas Knapp, who founded the |Boston Tea Party; and attorney Ron Gunzburger, founder and publisher of the elections website Politics1.com. 


Tom Tancredo Image: US Congress.


Thomas Knapp Image: Avens O'Brien.


Ron Gunzburger Image: Ron Gunzburger.


In addition to his time in Congress, Tancredo ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination.  During his run he spoke to Wikinews in an exclusive interview.  Afterwards, Tancredo ran for Governor of Colorado in 2010 as the nominee of the Constitution Party, finishing the race in second place.  He later returned to the Republican Party.


Tancredo predicts President Trump wins re-election over former Vice President Biden with an electoral count of 362 to 176.


In 2008, Knapp stood as the first vice presidential nominee of the Boston Tea Party, which disbanded in 2012.  Historian Darcy Richardson picked Knapp as his running mate for his 2016 campaign for the Reform Party's presidential nomination.  Knapp runs the politics blog KN@PPSTER and is the director and senior news analyst of The William Lloyd Garrison Center for Libertarian Advocacy Journalism.


Knapp predicts former Vice President Biden defeats President Trump with an electoral count of 319 to 219.


Gunzburger, a trial lawyer since 1988, founded the nonpartisan Politics1.com in 1997.  He currently serves as senior advisor to Maryland's Republican Governor Larry Hogan.  According to Twitter, he describes himself as a centrist Democrat.


Gunzburger predicts former Vice President Biden defeats President Trump with an electoral count of 359 to 179.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Joe_Biden_projected_US_president-elect,2020-11-07,Joe Biden projected US president-elect,"Today, former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden was projected by multiple media outlets to have surpassed 270 electoral college delegate total and therefore become the 46th President of the United States elect.


His running mate, Kamala Harris, would become the first female and first African- and Asian-American vice president.  


At around 11:25am US east coast time (1625 UTC), the Associated Press (AP) called the election for Biden, as did NBC News, when Biden was declared to have won Pennsylvania's 20 electoral college votes. Later in the day, the AP and NBC News also called Nevada for Biden, giving him an additional six electoral college votes, for a total by NBC's reckoning of 279 electoral votes to President Donald Trump's 214, or 290 electoral votes by AP's reckoning.


Biden said in a statement, ""I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris"". He added, ""With the campaign over, it's time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation. It's time for America to unite. And to heal [...] We are the United States of America. And there's nothing we can't do, if we do it together.""


President Trump has yet to concede, saying earlier in the morning before the call for Biden, ""I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!"" on Twitter. Following the announcement of Biden's win, Trump issued a statement at his golf club outside Washington, D.C. saying, ""The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor"". The lack of a concession from Trump has no legal standing.

Reports said at least 116 people died due to this earthquake, while the number of casualties rose to at least 1,035 in Turkey and about 19 in Greece. 


On the Greek island of Samos, two people died when a wall collapsed.  The disaster caused buildings on Samos and in the west coast city of Izmir, Turkey, to collapse or be severely damaged. The earthquake also caused a ""mini tsunami"" to flood some streets of Samos and Izmir.


The earthquake occurred on Friday with its epicentre in the Aegean Sea near Samos.  Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency reported the magnitude of the earthquake was 6.6 and, as of Wednesday, 1885 aftershocks had occurred since the earthquake.  The US Geological Survey reported it was of 7.0 magnitude.


Local officials said on Saturday, about 20 buildings collapsed.  Early reports suggested police and people used simple tools such as chainsaws to rescue people who were trapped.


Turkey and Greece had earlier had poor relations over disputed resources in the Mediterranean, but the leaders of the two countries spoke by telephone on Friday night, and publicly expressed their willingness to help each other.

The demonstrations were initially peaceful, but clashes with counter-protesters broke out by the evening hours.


Video captured two factions pushing, punching, and throwing projectiles. A report alleged fireworks and flash bangs were used.    


As a result of Saturday's unrest, according to a report citing the mayor's office, twenty people were arrested, and two police officers were injured.  President Trump lashed out at the capital city's Democratic mayor Muriel Bowser on Twitter, accusing her of ""not doing her job"". The president has blamed Democratic leadership for violence and unrest in various US cities throughout 2020.


The president has not yet conceded the election, and has claimed widespread voter fraud with mail-in ballots, and made various legal challenges. State and federal election officials have stated there is currently no evidence to support the President's claims of widespread voter fraud.

On November 16, code-sharing and hosting service GitHub re-enabled the public access to youtube-dl repository, a software which can download videos from the internet via the command-line.  This move comes after Mitchell Stoltz, a Senior Staff Attorney of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), sent a letter to GitHub on the behalf of youtube-dl's maintainers.  The repository was previously blocked on October 23,  after GitHub received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notice from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).


Started in July 2008, youtube-dl is a free/libré open source software written in Python which can download videos from various websites.  Citing alleged violation of 17 U.S. Code § 1201 Circumvention of copyright protection systems, RIAA's takedown notice had alleged youtube-dl was intended to circumvent the technological protection measures of streaming services and to redistribute music videos without authorisation.  youtube-dl's source code had a number of unit tests to check if the software works in different circumstances or not.  Some of the test cases included URLs of some copyrighted songs.


In the letter to GitHub, EFF's attorney Stoltz said ""This file contains series of automated tests that verify the functionality of youtube-dl for streaming various types of video.  The youtube-dl source code does not, of course, contain copies of these songs or any others [...] the unit tests do not cause a permanent download or distribution of the songs they reference; they merely stream a few seconds of each song to verify the operation of youtube-dl. Streaming a small portion of a song in a non-permanent fashion to test the operation of an independently created software program is a fair use.""  The letter stressed  ""youtube-dl does not decrypt video streams that are encrypted with commercial DRM technologies"".


The URLs to copyrighted songs were removed from the source code on November 16, and replaced with a test video that uploaded on YouTube by Philipp Hagemeister, former maintainer of youtube-dl.  Philipp Hagemeister had previously spoken about the takedown with Wikinews.


youtube-dl comes with a small JavaScript interpreter where it acts as a web-browser would behave while receiving video data from the server. The script has ""extractors"" for various websites to handle videos from different sources.  ""Any software capable of running JavaScript code can derive the URL of  the  video  stream  and  access  the  stream,  regardless  of  whether  the  software  has  been approved by YouTube"", the letter read.  It borrowed an analogy of Doors of Durin from J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings for explanation: travelers come upon a door that has writing in a foreign language.  When translated, the writing says ""say 'friend' and enter.""  The  travelers say ""friend"" and the door opens.  As with the writing on that door, YouTube presents instructions on accessing video streams to everyone who comes asking for it.


Hours after the public access was restored, Sergey M, one of the maintainers of youtube-dl wrote on GitHub, ""We would like to thank @github for standing up for youtube-dl and making it possible to continue development without dropping any features. We appreciate [GitHub] for taking potential legal risks in this regard.  We would also like to thank [EFF] and personally [Mitch Stoltz] for invaluable legal help.  We would also like to heartily thank our main website hoster Uberspace who is currently being sued in Germany for hosting our essentially business card website and who have already spent thousands of Euros in their legal defense.""


Hours after GitHub restored the public access to the repository, Stoltz tweeted ""I think of youtube-dl as a successor to the videocassette recorder.  The VCR empowered people to take control of their personal use of free-to-air video, but it had to be saved from the copyright cartel.  The same goes for youtube-dl.  GitHub did the right thing here.""


youtube-dl is used by thousands of people around the world. Multiple Creative Commons-licensed and public domain videos on Wikimedia Commons are uploaded via a tool called video2commons, which relies on youtube-dl to download media.  youtube-dl also lets users download videos from LiveLeak — a video-sharing platform for citizen journalism.  Videos downloaded using youtube-dl are also used for the purpose of fair use, or for evidence.  When a copyright holder chooses to release their work, be it a photograph, a video, or audio, under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, they allow everyone to freely own, share or modify the work as long as the reusers properly attribute the author of the work.  YouTube also hosts many audio and video recordings in the public domain which can be used for any purpose without any restrictions.


In the blog post announcing ""youtube-dl is back"", GitHub said, ""Although we did initially take the project down, we understand that just because code can be used to access copyrighted works doesn't mean it can't also be used to access works in non-infringing ways.  We also understood that this project's code has many legitimate purposes, including changing playback speeds for accessibility, preserving evidence in the fight for human rights, aiding journalists in fact-checking, and downloading Creative Commons-licensed or public domain videos.""


GitHub also announced any new 1201 takedown notices will be ""carefully scrutinised by legal experts"" to reject ""unwarranted claims"", and said it will side with software developers if the claims are ambiguous.  The announcement also mentioned GitHub Trust and Safety team would treat developer's tickets as a ""top priority"".  GitHub also pledged donation of USD 1 million for developer defense fund ""to help protect open source developers on GitHub from unwarranted DMCA Section 1201 takedown claims"".


GitHub had blocked public access to many forks of youtube-dl upon receiving the DMCA notice in October.  Wikinews notes public access is not yet restored for the forked repositories listed in RIAA's copyright notice and still displays ""Repository unavailable due to DMCA takedown"".


During the period when GitHub had disabled public access for the repository, Sergey M had been developing youtube-dl and hosting it on GitLab, another code-sharing and hosting site.  However, since GitHub has restored public access of youtube-dl, Sergey M has made the GitLab repository private.


After this, Wikinews reached out to Richard Stallman, the founder of Free Software Foundation, who has been highly critical of DRM (digital rights management, the subject of the DMCA) for many years now, to discuss the harms of DRM and DMCA 1201.


What is DRM and whose rights [is] the DRM trying to protect?


((Richard Stallman))  Well, DRM as I consider it, stands for digital restrictions management.  It stands for system functionalities designed to restrict users in their use of copies of works.  It's an injustice.  It is a system of giving, generally, the more powerful additional power over everyone else.  They [who implement DRM] like to say that this is a matter of protecting rights, but it's really a matter of protecting power.  That power is an injustice and it should not exist.


((WN))  What do you think of the Recording Industries Association of America's DMCA take down notice against youtube-dl?


((Richard Stallman))  Oh.  Well it was, as I understand it, it was entirely a distortion of the law.  And the Electronic Frontier Foundation explained why that was so.  And I believe that's why GitHub put it back up again.  But I'm more concerned with the morality of it than the legality of it.  And basically it was a system
of oppression.  But that's what the DMCA was mainly there to achieve: Make it easier to repress.


((WN))  Why was the DMCA introduced?


((Richard Stallman))  Well of course I don't know the motives.  I can only try to guess.  The DMCA give more power to publishing companies and secondarily occasionally to authors and artists to stop people from sharing.  Now that was visible here it was to stop people from sharing youtube-dl.  But the DRM portions of the DMCA were designed to stop people from breaking the digital handcuffs that companies place on them.


So before 1998, companies tried implementing DRM and people who didn't like being handcuffed by DRM implemented ways to break the handcuffs.  The DRM[...] the DMCA made that much more difficult and it's been followed by hardware designed to restrict the people who use it — the people who supposedly buy it — are forbidden to change the parts of it that are designed to restrict them.


((WN))  Is the existence of DRM necessary for the DMCA to serve its purpose?


((Richard Stallman))  Well, if the purpose is to repress, then yes, the DMCA; a part of the DMCA: because the DMCA says many different things.  So there are two parts of the DMCA that are pertinent here.  There's the part that sets up the takedown system and then there's a part about DRM and forbidding the distribution of any equipment to break DRM.  So you you better say which one you mean because there's so much else in the DMCA.


The large goal of the DMCA is basically to stop people from sharing.  And both of those parts of the DMCA serve the purpose of stopping people from sharing.  I believe sharing copies of published works should be lawful and any law designed to stop that — any law against that — is an attack on society.


So if the goal is to to divide people and stop them from sharing, well DRM certainly contributes to that goal.


((WN))  Is the DRM really harmful for an independent society — a society which is not controlled by a select few companies.


((Richard Stallman))  Oh, well DRM tends to increase the control of certain areas of society by companies, and especially large companies.  You see, a truly effective DRM scheme typically involves  getting everyone to follow the same standard to restrict people so there are no exceptions.  They need something like a monopoly.   If there were effective competition — competition between systems and practices that are
diverse — then people would find ways to get copies without DRM.  But what happens instead is a DRM conspiracy is set up whereby all the publishers start using — although they're supposedly competing and may in fact be competing in some other sense — in regard to their use of DRM, they're all the same.  So just about everyone publishing recorded videos at one point switched to DVDs.  The DVDs were designed to have DRM.  It's all the same DRM system.  And they were all basically the same player system.


And it means that basically competition does people no good.  You can't find a publisher that's publishing the same things but without DRM: they're all restricting you the same.  So if you are completely firm in your hatred of DRM like me you say well I just won't buy any such thing.  But if you're not so firm you'll probably surrender and go along with the restrictions of the system that they've switched to, which at that time meant DVDs.  And then, because people had found ways to break the DRM of DVDs, another sort of monopolistic system for DRM was designed and that was Blu-ray discs.  And you'll notice that all sorts of video publishing companies started publishing on Blu-ray discs.  Well that was one single technical standard with the same DRM.  And they all used the same DRM implementing disc players for Blu-ray discs.  So they have a chance of success when they avoid competition.  If there were enough competition, some publishers might start saying, ""Hey we'll publish without the DRM.""   My understanding is, you can't write a Blu-ray disc that doesn't have DRM.  I've been told you can't make and sell Blu-ray discs that anyone can copy.  That was one example of a change for the worst compared with DVDs.  You can write DVDs that don't implement the DRM.


((WN))  What are some of the ways DRM mistreats the users without them actually knowing about it?


((Richard Stallman))  Well, when DRM mistreats you, you'll notice.  You know, if you can't copy the contents into a file on your disk you'll notice.  So there are many malicious things that programs can do to users without users knowing for instance spying on users.  It could have a back-door.  And unless you notice the use of the back door, you can't tell.  But DRM is one thing that you can tell.


((WN))  How according to you should the laws concerning intellectual property should be applied?


((Richard Stallman))  I'm afraid that question is fundamentally confused by use of the vague over-generalisation ""intellectual property"".  Are you talking about patent laws?


((WN))  No, I'm talking law specifically for Intellectual Property Protection.


((Richard Stallman))  Sorry, you don't understand.  The term ""intellectual property"" is applied to many different kinds of laws.  For instance, patent laws.  When you ask that question whether you know it or not, you're asking about patent laws.  That term is also commonly applied to trade secrecy.  So whether you know it or not, your question is asking about trade secret law.  And it's also applied to trademarks, which really just you know those are just name.  And the trademark law just says what that you can register a trademark and then other people can't call their products by that name.  So whether you knew it or not your question was asking about those laws too.  There are also plant variety monopolies, which are not the same as patents, and you were asking about those laws too.  And there is also copyright law.  So whether you knew it or not, you were asking about copyright law.  And there are others I don't even know what all of them are.  Because there's so many and they're all different.  And you were asking about all of those laws at once because you said ""intellectual property"".


I recognised about 20 years ago that that term ""intellectual property"" reliably causes confusion because it asks about so many different laws at once and these laws are totally different; they apply to different areas; they have different purposes.  Rhey're designed to achieve different things but that term ""intellectual property"" treats them as if they were all minor variations of the same thing and they're not.


So every time you use that term, you're causing yourself to be confused and other people who think your question or statement is meaningful will get confused too.  So I decided to reject that term completely because I want people to understand the differences between these various laws and they can't understand that until they realize that these laws are different.


Can you try to make your question specific enough that I could answer it?


((WN))  There are a lot of complaints which try to hide behind these's IP laws in order to protect the software. 


((Richard Stallman))  They hide behind the term ""intellectual property"" to prevent it from becoming clear which law they're talking about and what the issue is in the case.  But actually to speak of ""protecting software""  there's another sneaky point there.  What does it mean to ""protect software""?  Prevent it from being destroyed?  Prevent it from being erased?  Protect normally means — to something means — to stop it from being destroyed or damaged or ruined.  So for instance, if somebody threatens to break a DVD, well a DVD of software, and you ""stopped"" the person from destroying the disk, that would be protecting software, right?   That's protecting software by the usual meaning of the word ""protect"".


When in that kind of question when they say protect, it's bogus.  So I would say to them ""What do you mean by that?  What exactly is the thing you're trying to stop?""  I would refuse to take up the intentionally confusing terminology like protect software.  I would insist on getting a concrete description of what you're trying to do.  And then I could give a concrete response do you want to give a concrete description?  Of course you're quoting the others, you're not saying that this is your goal.  You're talking about others who say that this is their goal.  And if they're speaking gobbledygook well you can't tell what they really mean.  I'm saying that when they use that terminology they are basically confusing people.


It's gobbledygook.  It's not a real question.  And I would refuse to try to engage with their gobbledygook.  I talk about concrete questions that I can describe like should anyone be able to stop you from making a copy of something.  And if you want we can make it more concrete than that but you'll have to say which concrete case you mean.  The point is I don't believe that anyone should have the power to stop you from making a copy to give to your friend or to somebody you just met.  And if somebody wants to try to argue for that we should give that power, well the onus is on per to demonstrate why person should have that power.


((WN))  A person who paid for a tool owns it and is used to modify as they wish, for example you do not like the color of your chair, paint it if your car's tire is flat, change it or ask a mechanic to help you with that, except for cases where there is a computer and usually a software involved.


((Richard Stallman))  Yeah.  Well I think you should have the same freedom to change the software.  And that relates to the issue of free mukt or swatantra software.  I have fought for free software because I believe all users who are running programs should have the freedom to change those programs or get someone else to help change them.  And that's why I've developed free programs and released them to give other people that freedom.  And that's why I refuse to run non-free programs because they subjugate their users by stopping the users from changing those programs.  It means that the users don't have control of their own computing.  I consider that unacceptable so I don't accept it.  I simply say I won't use that non-free software, take it away.


((WN))  But why is computer software treated differently than other tools?  For example, if we take case of John Deere tractors.


((Richard Stallman))  Oh well, morally, it shouldn't be.  Morally, all software should be free.  Users should always get the source code and they should be able to change it and publish modified versions so that others can get the benefit of their changes.


Now, I can tell you practically speaking why it is not treated the same way.  It's because software was treated as a kind of written work.  Written works were covered by copyright law.  They generally were not tools of any sort, you looked at them.  You didn't pick up a written work and turn something with it.  Right it's not a tool in the same sense as a screwdriver is.  And physical structures were treated legally different from collections of text which is what a program is.  And so carrying forward those two existing practices, they ended up saying that programs were copyrighted and at this point the lobbying of the companies, some of which were already large in the 1980s, was enough to cause copyright law in the US to be interpreted in rather strange ways for software.  For instance, companies started saying: this program is copyrighted and it's a trade secret.  Now it used to be that copyright applied to published works and anything that's a secret is not published.  If it were published it wouldn't be a secret anymore.  But the companies lobbied and they were allowed to have it both ways.  They could say the source code is a secret and the compiled executable is published.  And so they could have the benefit of copyright law and trade secret law for the same work at the same time.


Now, if the people writing the laws had been thinking based on what is in the public interest, they might have said that's absurd but they were thinking about ""how can I please these companies that will give me a job later.  You know, once I'm not in office anymore, I want to get paid by companies"".  So they did things to please the companies which probably told them, ""We'll have work for you later"".  That system is known as the revolving door between business and government and it's fundamentally a form of corruption, even though it's not necessarily illegal.  But morally speaking it's corruption.


So what we ended up with, well, so we ended up with software that was copyrighted and the source code was secret and thus the company had two ways to restrict the users of that program.  One was they couldn't get the source code so they couldn't change it really except by patching the binary and that's hard to do: it's hard to make a very big change by patching the binary.  And at the same time it was copyrighted so they were forbidden to redistribute it.  And if they so if they managed to patch the binary they were not allowed to share that with anybody else.  And so the users were helplessly under the power of that company.  That was the situation in the early 80s which led me to develop free software and start the free software movement.  And meanwhile non-free software led to DRM.  You see, in order for a program that's intended to restrict users to succeed in restricting users, it has to be secret.  Or else there has to be something that stops the users from changing it, and stops them in some other way.  Because you know, if someone puts some shackles on you and you can then change the shape of the shackles so you can take them off your feet, they're not really effective shackles, are they?


((WN))  You see this is rather odd that a car manufacturer never stops the users from opening the bonnet and expect what is underneath or even change it.


((Richard Stallman))  Well yes, actually with software they do exactly that.  And that's basically what John Deere is doing with the tractors.  Because now there are computers in the car or the tractor and the computers are running software.  The software is an important part of the car or the tractor and that's what the supposed owner can't change.  So when you see that, you get to see the evil of non-free software and I don't think they should be allowed to sell cars with non-free software in them.  I think that they should be required to make the software free so users can change the programs.


((WN))  What changes to the current system do you propose?


((Richard Stallman))  Well, that's rather complicated.  [T]he changes I propose in laws and the system of distributing for the legal system for publication.  Basically I think all software should be free.  Free as is in freedom of course.  I don't mind if you charge money for a copy but the software that you distribute should always respect users freedom.  However, I am against making it a crime to distribute a non-free program, simply because criminalising such things tends to fail to achieve its goal.  I mean, look at for instance dangerous drugs, that it's a crime to sell but people just break those laws massively and meanwhile in the US hundreds of thousands of people, maybe more than a million are in prison for breaking those laws and yet people are still doing it in tremendous quantities.  So that's the only reason I wouldn't want to make it a crime to distribute non-free software.  But it shouldn't happen.  For other kinds of works, however, we have to look at copyright and I would say that works that are meant to serve a practical purpose, such as textbooks, for instance, or reference works, they should all be free as in freedom also.  However, for other kinds of works, such as artistic works and works of testimony, it's okay for those works to be copyrighted.  But people should at least be allowed to non-commercially redistribute exact copies.  So you should be allowed to be a good member of your community, which includes among other things making copies and sharing them.


Now, if you have a copy of something and your friend says, ""hey could I have a copy of that?"", of course you will want to share a copy that's the friendly thing to do.


((WN))  What do you think of DRM actively trying to stop the right to repair?


((Richard Stallman))  Well, the right to repair is basically a small part of the freedom that free software gives.  So of course I support the right to repair and anything that works against it is wrong.  But I would go much further in the right to repair.  I would say the software in your car, your tractor or your radio or whatever it might be should be free software.  And that basically, that provides the right to repair because it means that the users of the product can study how it works and they can extract the knowledge needed to do the repairs and share that knowledge, you know write it down, publish it and that way all the users of the product will be able to repair it.


((WN))  What do you think of the companies today leasing their products or services as per the EULA and abusing DMCA and DRM to prevent the consumers from having control of the things they own?


((Richard Stallman))  [L]easing a product; if a company leases a product to you then you don't own it, however I would say that if you have the possession of the product for the long term, that's enough reason why the software in it should be free.  So you should be free to change that software.  Of course, maybe someday you terminate the lease and you return the product and they probably will restore the standard software inside it before they lease it to someone else.


((WN))  When I say product/services I meant the so-called software-as-a-service.


((Richard Stallman))  Oh, software-as-a-service -- it's too vague a term to mean anything.  It's of interest perhaps to  businesses for thinking about their strategies, but in terms of how they're treating customers it's too vague, it doesn't mean anything.


((WN))  I could call it service-as-a-software-substitute.


((Richard Stallman))  Oh that's different, you see, though.  That is a much more specific term.  It doesn't cover as many different cases and that's why I use it because it's more specific, it's narrow enough that I can say something coherent about it.  I can't really say anything about ""software-as-a-service"" because it's too broad, it's too varied.  Service-as-a-software-substitute I can say something about because it is less varied.  It means that the service consists of running a certain program for you.  And my response is don't let someone else run it for you, run it yourself.  If it's a free program and you run it yourself, you have control over it and that's the way it should be.  If it's a free program, but you pay someone else to run it for you, then you don't really get control over what that program is doing, because it's running in a someone else's computer.


Of course, if it's a non-free program then even if you run it yourself you don't really have control.  You don't have control over what it does, but you have more control if you were running it than if someone else is running it.


((WN))  So what do you mean when you say you own a copy of a software?


((Richard Stallman))  Well, with free software, when you get a copy, you own it the same way you could own a chair.  You buy a chair you own it.  With a free software you buy a copy you own it.  But with, say consider, for instance, some software package you might think that you're buying a copy, but the company will say you don't own it, you just have a license to run it under limited terms.  Well I think that is mistreatment of the public.  That's part of the reason why I won't ever use that software.


((WN))  [T]alking about software, what are the set of rights an owner of a software must have?


((Richard Stallman))  What do you mean by owner of a program?  Do you mean the developer, do you mean
a user?


((WN))  Anybody who bought the software.


((Richard Stallman))  Okay, so first of all, well, I would say since we're talking about the user of a program, that software should be free.  And that means that the user, any user, gets the four essential freedoms: Freedom zero is the freedom to run the program however you wish for whatever purpose you have in mind.  Freedom one is the freedom to study the source code of that program so they've got to give you the source and then change it so it functions the way you wish.  Freedom two is the freedom to make exact copies and then give or sell them to others and freedom 3 is the freedom to make copies of your modified versions and give or sell them to others.


((WN))  You talk about reselling.  Now it is completely okay if I had to resell a vehicle.  But in case, if it came with a software, let's take example of Tesla.


((Richard Stallman))  Oh well please be careful.  You're using the term resell which is not a term I used.  What I said is the freedom to make copies and then give the or sell those copies to others.  Now that's not reselling in the usual sense of that word.  Because what I'm talking about involves making more copies.  With a free program, you have the right to copy it and give or sell the copies.  You also have with a free program you have the right to change the code and then copy that and give or sell copies.


So this is a rather firm stand.  It's not the same thing as you bought a car and you sell the same car to somebody else.


((WN))  Should that right also be protected for the free software.  If I get a copy of the software, should I be allowed to give that copy to someone else permanently?  Let's say I bought it on a DVD and I would give that DVD to someone else, me not having the copy at all.


((Richard Stallman))  Well, that I expect is is lawful nowadays although there are some that will try to make you sign a contract and won't let users get copies without that.  And that is an additional level of oppression.  But I'm going far beyond that.  I'm not just saying you should be allowed to resell the same copy.  I'm saying you should have the freedom to copy it to, make more copies.


((WN))  So while we are speaking about selling the exact the copy itself now consider this the Amazon Kindle.  It comes it comes with the account tied to the Amazon account.  If I were to give it to someone else the books would not transfer.


((Richard Stallman))  Well, that's one of the injustices of DRM.  This is one of the reasons I would never use an Amazon eBook, and I never have.  No company should know what books you have.  No company should be able to stop you from giving those books or selling those books to someone else.  And if the book is digital, that means it is possible to copy it so no company should be able to stop you from non-commercially copying and redistributing those books.  If you have a book and I would like a copy of it and you wish to copy it, you should be allowed to copy it for me.  You shouldn't have to, but if you feel like to, you know it might be a lot of trouble and you'd say ""I'm sorry, I'm too busy"", but if you want to do it and suppose it's easy, then you should be allowed to do it.  So I'm not just against the specific method which is DRM I'm against the goal.  It is ostensibly meant to achieve that goal shouldn't be achieved by anything.  People should be free to share.


((WN))  Why do you think the EULA exists?


((Richard Sanskrit))  Oh, well you mean why do companies impose EULAs on programs.  Well they want to restrict people.  They're trying to subjugate users.  They have many ways of doing that.  I have never agreed to any EULA.


((WN))  You know the analogy that I prefer for DRM is think of a car that you just purchased.  The seller tells you that 'if it breaks down, come bring it to me and I'll fix it for you'.  One day you realise that it's not working.  Turns out the exhaust pipe has some blockage in it and if you try to fix that now the seller tells you, ""just because you did that now not only I'm not going to fix if the car breaks down I won't even let others fix it for you"".


((Richard Stallman))  I would say I don't think they are similar.  They're not really analogous.  I would say that restriction on a car is comparable to the restrictions on proprietary software regardless of DRM.  You know any non-free program because typically it's impossible for you to fix it because they don't give you the source code.  Even if you are an authorised user, you can't have the source code for most non-free programs.  The source code's not released at all.  So you can't fix it yourself.  Now these various situations they're related but they're not closely analogous.  They're not the same thing going on in these different fields.  They're often somewhat different and both evil but not in exactly the same way.


((WN))  How has the software distribution changed over the decade specifically in the rights that the users had?


((Richard Stallman))  Well, non-free software started to exist in the 1960s at least maybe in the 1950s.  But in the 1970s free software almost ceased to exist -- all the software with small exceptions was proprietary, non-free.  And it was in the 1980s that I launched the attempt to re-establish free software and to liberate users.


((WN))  What are the problems with the DMCA 1201 which is circumvention of copyright protection [measures]?


((Richard Stallman))  Well that basically the worst part of that is the complete prohibition on distributing things that -- tools that can break DRM.  So for instance, anything that could access the video on a DVD or a BluRay disc is forbidden unless some company gives permission for it.  I'm not sure which company is allowed to give permission for it.  But basically you can't get permission for that so it has to be an underground device, one that is circulated without permission -- a forbidden tool.


((WN))  What are the modifications that you would propose for the DMCA laws regarding anti-circumvention?


((Richard Stallman))  I would eliminate them entirely.  I might make -- I might go further, yeah, I would go further and say that making or selling or leasing or importing what is it making importing selling or leasing any product with DRM is a crime.


((WN))  Is the Free Software Foundation, SF Conservancy and the Electronic Frontier Foundation aware of and working with any senator to sponsor a bill [for these changes]?


((Richard Stallman))  I don't know what those other organisations are doing.  I don't think the Free Software Foundation has contacts so high in government.  You know opposition to anti-circumvention existed around 20 years ago but it mostly got crushed what happens is most people will not continue to oppose the law once it has existed for some number of years.  It's too easy for people to say ""well we lost that one, now what battle are we gonna fight?""  But people like me, we never give up.


DRM is evil and since I will never accept a copy of anything with the DRM, I have to fight against DRM.


((WN))  What are some of the ways a digital publisher can sell copyrighted works...?


((Richard Stallman))  The words you are using, I will not accept.  I'm not going to answer that question because to do it I would have to accept the concept of piracy and the concept of protected and I will not.  I refuse to use them.  When people, when they say piracy what they mean is sharing.  It's a smear term to insult people who share.  I will not smear sharing.  I think sharing is good and stopping people from sharing is evil.  Now I when they say protected, what they really mean is restricting.  And I think that's bad.  However I am in favor of supporting artists better the existing system changes so as to support artists less and less.  Now this has become a scandal in the field of music as the streaming disservices pay musicians so little when streaming their music that the musicians are basically going broke.  What this shows by the way is the hypocrisy of the copyright system which ostensibly exists to support the artists.  But in fact it supports businesses that screw the artists.


Well instead of trying to fix that system I say let's replace it and in the article in the page I told you about -- copyright versus community, I propose two different two alternative systems to support artists.  So take a look at it.


((WN))  How should artists and publishers who sell their art (music, artwork, literature) in a digital form sell it without imposing DRM, without worrying about one individual paying for it, an redistributing it to a larger audience, non-commercially?


((Richard Stallman))  You must accept that people will do this, because it would be wrong to try to stop them.


((WN))  How do you think the browsers are affected by implemented by w3c allowing EMEs [Encrypted Media Extensions] to exist?


((Richard Stallman))  You mean allowing DRM in browser?  Well, basically what that means is free browsers cannot support the entire web standards.  The DRM is something that only non-free browsers can do.  So you have to decide do you want freedom or do you want to surrender to DRM and access the DRM covered works.  For me the choice is clear.  I won't accept a copy of a DRM infected work.  But the danger is that is will we be able to keep free browsers going at all.


((WN))  I believe in the announcements Mozilla mentioned how they had to choose between either supporting DRM or otherwise giving up on their[...]


((Richard Stallman))  Yeah, well that's basically that's how these schemes are set up.  Most users don't understand freedom.  They have superficial short-term desires.  They want to get copies.  So if a conspiracy of publishers -- and that's effectively what it was all, people don't like to think of it that way -- if a conspiracy of publishers says ""we're all going to publish using this scheme to restrict you, so if you want to get anything from of the kind of work that we publish DRM will be your only way"", people will say all right we'll accept the DRM.  And then they push browser developers like Firefox and stores and so on into handling the DRM subjugated tools and products except for people like me who say, ""No thanks, I don't want any of those at all ever"".


((WN))  Was the [GNU] GPLv3 rather too late to prevent [damages of DRM]?


((Richard Stallman))  I'm afraid so.  I'm afraid so.  Although of course, we don't know what would have happened if history had been different.  You can only speculate about that.


((WN))  Is there any scenario where DRM is morally justifiable?


((Richard Stallman))  Not that I can imagine.  The users should be, first of all DRM means non-free software designed to stop people from doing things with copies of published works.  I don't think users should be stopped from copying and changing and sharing published works.  For art, they don't have to.  I don't think users have to be permitted to distribute modified versions.  But they must be permitted to non-commercially share copies and DRM always prohibits that.


((WN))  Are you aware of snaps and flatpaks that are used to install applications [on GNU/Linux]?


((Richard Stallman))  I've heard of it and I know that they can be used to install non-free software which of course it's a it's foolish to do.  You shouldn't trust a non-free program.  But yes you can install non-free software.  That has always been true and the reason is with free software ultimately you can do whatever you want.  There's no way to stop you.  So a free operating system always permits you to install non-free programs.


((WN))  The applications, which would otherwise be available in the distribution repository.  Now, the software developers are just moving towards...


((Richard Stallman))  That's a bad thing.  That's a bad thing.  It's a foolish thing.  It's hard to trust these snaps and flatpaks.  And not only that, but those platforms distribute non-free software, so it's a bad idea to point to them at all.  And in addition, it means that there aren't multiple --  you know with with distributions, as distributions package a program they will look at the program and thus they can fix things, if they see anything bad they can change it.  And thus, this is part of how users collectively maintain their control.  I've never installed a snap or a flatpak.  And I don't think I want to.  I wouldn't.  I don't trust it.  How do I know whether that flatpak includes some non-free software.  How could I check?  I don't think they're designed to let people check.  They're not designed for anyone to be able to build the program.  As far as I know, I could be mistaken but if all everybody does is just install the binaries, in the flatpak, nobody's building it, how does anybody know if the complete source is available.

His lawyers had reportedly set up a drive to collect donations for the defendant. His sister made public requests for assistance in raising funds for her brother's bail. Shortly after Rittenhouse's release, one of his lawyers posted a photo to Twitter showing him and actor Ricky Schroder standing next to each other and smiling.


A resident of Antioch, Illinois, Rittenhouse is accused of crossing state lines and shooting and killing two people who were participating in demonstrations protesting the shooting of Jacob Blake. One other person was injured in the altercation. Rittenhouse's charges include intentional homicide and illegally possessing a firearm.  If convicted, Rittenhouse could receive up to a lifetime prison sentence.


Rittenhouse was not old enough to own or possess a firearm in the state of Illinois at the time of the incident. He claimed to have obtained his weapon by having an older friend purchase it on his behalf using stimulus money Rittenhouse received from the state during the coronavirus lockdown. A suspect in Wisconsin has been charged for allegedly providing the weapon to Rittenhouse.


Rittenhouse turned himself in to authorities on the morning following the shooting, and his lawyers have claimed the defendant acted in self defense. Court Commissioner Loren Keating said he considered Rittenhouse a flight risk, prior to setting the US$2 million bond. 
Rittenhouse, in remarks to The Washington Post, contended he would have died had he not been armed that night. Some conservative groups have come to Rittenhouse's defense regarding the incident.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/US_federal_agency_announces_plans_to_begin_presidential_transition_process_following_Trump_election_loss,2020-11-26,US federal agency announces plans to begin presidential transition process following Trump election loss,"On Monday, United States General Services Administration administrator Emily W. Murphy sent a letter to President-elect Joe Biden and his team, giving them permission to access what she described as post-election resources for a presidential transition process following the 2020 US Presidential Election on November 3, which multiple national news outlets have projected former US Vice President Joe Biden won against incumbent US President Donald Trump.


Murphy claimed she made this decision without influence from the White House, insisting she was ""never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch official"". However, she claimed she and her family had received violent threats due to her involvement in the process of allowing the incoming president elect access to federal documents. 


President Trump, who appointed Murphy to her position himself in 2017, responded to her letter on Twitter, calling for the beginning of a presidential transition process ""in the best interests of the country"". The president's response is a drastic departure in tone from his previous rhetoric and demeanor regarding the issue, in which he asserted he had won the election despite several key swing states certifying their results in favor of Biden. 


The president did not concede or admit defeat in the election in his statement, however, and vowed to keep fighting ""the good fight"" with court cases challenging the election results in swing states. 


To date, the president's claims of widespread voter fraud have not gained any momentum in the courts. Two days prior to Michigan's final certification of its election results, a federal judge dismissed a Trump lawsuit attempting to prevent the state of Pennsylvania from certifying their results.


Trump and his legal team have come under scrutiny from both sides of the aisle in response to their claims of election fraud. Biden and others in the Democratic Party warned the delayed transition process could potentially be a threat to national security, in withholding resources from Biden and his team. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer commented the president's tweets Monday are likely as near as the US public will ever have to an official concession from the president. 


Other Republicans have broken with Trump and have urged him to move forward with the presidential transition, such as former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who denounced the Trump legal team's claims as a ""national embarrassment"". Additionally, businessman and Trump loyalist Stephen Schwarzman said the president should accept the election outcome and ""move on"". Over 100 Republican national security experts signed an open letter urging Republican officials to push the president to concede the election.


Traditionally, the General Services Administration has acted once the national media has called the presidential race for a candidate. Joe Biden is projected to win the electoral college and was also victorious in the popular vote, winning by over six million votes. He was projected on November 7 to have won, and would be sworn into office on January 20.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Red_Hat_to_move_focus_away_from_CentOS_in_favour_of_Stream;_CentOS_team_discuss_implications_with_Wikinews,2020-12-14,Red Hat to move focus away from CentOS in favour of Stream; CentOS team discuss implications with Wikinews,"On Tuesday, US-based software company Red Hat announced their plans to shift their focus away from CentOS in favour of CentOS Stream.


In the blog post Chris Wright, the Chief Technological Officer of Red Hat said Red Hat had informed the CentOS governing board that Red Hat was ""shifting our investment fully from CentOS Linux to CentOS Stream"".  At least five of the nine CentOS Governing Board listed on the project are Red Hat employees.  


Started in 2004, CentOS has been a free-of-cost free/libre open source software which provided binary-code compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) — Red Hat's GNU General Public Licensed paid operating system.  CentOS was absorbed into Red Hat in 2014, with Red Hat gaining the trademark rights of ""CentOS"".


Red Hat also sponsors the Fedora operating system.  Red Hat even gives the software engineering interns laptops with Fedora on it.  Till now, software development took place on Fedora, which was later adopted in RHEL, which the Red Hat maintained and provided support for, for those customers who had RHEL subscription.  CentOS would then follow RHEL to provide the same features free of cost, but without the support.


Stream was announced in September 2019, just two months after Red Hat was acquired by IBM.  CentOS Stream's development cycle had new features added to it before the features became a part of RHEL.  Stream receives more frequent updates, however, it does not follow RHEL's release cycle.


With CentOS Stream, developments from the community and the Red Hat emplyees would take place beforehand on both Fedora, and Stream as a rolling release, before those features are absorbed into RHEL.  CentOS followed the release cycle of RHEL and therefore it was a stable distribution.  Features available in CentOS were tried and tested by Fedora, and then RHEL maintainers.  Stream, on the other hand, has features added to it before those features become a part of RHEL.  That implies Stream would be ahead of RHEL's development, containing new features which are not yet tried and tested by RHEL developers, and not be binary code-compatible with RHEL.


Writing ""The future of CentOS Linux is CentOS Stream"", Wright further wrote in the announcement, CentOS Stream ""provides a platform for rapid innovation at the community level but with a stable enough base to understand production dynamics.""  Wright also said, ""CentOS Stream isn't a replacement for CentOS Linux; rather, it's a natural, inevitable next step intended to fulfill the project's goal of furthering enterprise Linux innovation.""


Since the announcement was made, many people expressed their anger on Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Reddit and CentOS project's mailing list.  CentOS 8's End of Life (EOL) has been moved up from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, while CentOS 7 is expected to receive maintenance updates through June 2024, outliving CentOS 8.


Gregory Kurtzer, who had started the CentOS project, announced a new operating system, Rocky Linux.  Rocky Linux describes itself as ""a community enterprise Operating System designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Enterprise Linux"".  The project said ""Rocky Linux aims to function as a downstream build as CentOS had done previously, building releases after they have been added to the upstream vendor, not before.""  The project maintainers have not decided a date for when the operating system will be released.


Kurtzer explained the reason to call the OS as Rocky Linux: ""Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh.  He is no longer with us, so as a H/T [hat tip] to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you...Rocky Linux"".


Wikinews reached out to the members of the CentOS project, Pablo Greco and Rich Bowen, to discuss this move, its implications as well as the future of CentOS.  Greco is a maintainer of armhfp (32-bit processors) and is a part of the CentOS' quality assurance team.  Bowen — who unlike Greco, works for Red Hat — is the community manager of the CentOS project.


Can you tell me about your current role in the CentOS development, and how did you get involved with the project?


((Pablo Greco))  I'm the armhfp maintainer, basically helping out fixing things that are not part of the Red Hat supported architectures.  I do help out with other things like secondary kernels, and creating images for armhfp and aarch64.  I got involved not too long ago when a project that I was working on needed to use ARMv7 hardware, and although CentOS had a version, it wasn't complete.


((Rich Bowen))  I'm Rich Bowen and I'm the Community Manager for the CentOS project.  That means that it's my job to help people get involved in the project, manage the social media and newsletters (the ""voice"" of the project), and generally work with the community.  I've been at Red Hat for almost 8 years, and during that time have worked in this capacity with a couple of other projects, too.  I've been dedicated to the CentOS Project for going on 3 years now.  And I've been doing open source stuff for about 25 years now.


I should also note that I'm not alone — either on this team, or in responding to these questions.  I have a team of colleagues who help me out with CentOS through the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) at Red Hat, and across the many other departments that are part of the Fedora/Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)/CentOS projects at Red Hat.


There's also a number of colleagues looking over my shoulder as I write this response, to ensure that I get the story straight.  As a community manager, I'm not the technical expert on all the things, and so I need that support to get the details right in some of your questions.


((WN))  What is the relationship between CentOS and RHEL?


((Pablo Greco))  CentOS started as an external project, that was acquired by Red Hat 7 or 8 years ago.  But I don't think that it counts as an answer.  I think you'll get a better answer from people from Red Hat.


((Rich Bowen))  In many ways, it's the same as it's always been, but with a different end result and project structure.  This is a community-focused open source project that delivers a strong Linux distribution foundation where non-operating-system focused (""layered"") open source projects can develop, test, and innovate.  For example, Ceph and RDO.


The main shift with this evolution of a focus on CentOS Stream is how it is developed in the open, in the community space, allowing contributors to get involved in the creation and shaping of the future.  This also means RHEL users, customers, partners, independent hardware/software vendors, and anyone else can participate in the future of RHEL in true open source fashion.


In the past, the relationship between Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS was effectively, ""Fedora gets snapshot every so many years, then RHEL engineers develop RHEL behind closed doors until release day, then the RHEL source code is released, then CentOS would take the RHEL source and rebuild.""  While that is an oversimplification, it is essentially accurate.  Now the new structure is, ""Fedora gets snapshot every so often and becomes the basis for the next CentOS Stream release, then development happens in the open with community contribution involvement and influence, and then RHEL rebases frequently on CentOS Stream.""


This moment of integration is called ""the development phase"" in the RHEL engineering process.  This is being misinterpreted as a ""beta"".  Rather, this is an aspect of a distribution that is continuously delivered.


This is not software that is untested and not considered ready for inclusion in RHEL.  It is already planned for the next RHEL release, has passed QA [quality assurance] and CI [Continuous Integration] checks, and is considered stable.  In the past, this software went right into RHEL without external visibility.  We don't schedule software for inclusion into RHEL unless it has been used/tested/integrated at other levels (such as Fedora), and is considered stable enough for inclusion.  This same philosophy will still be at play with CentOS Stream.


One thing I would like to highlight here is this is the first time in the history of RHEL that development happens in the open and allows for collaboration and contribution from the broader open source community.  That is a large goal of CentOS Stream and we're making the move to focus on that entirely.


For an example of where this evolution has been discussed in the past, this presentation from Fedora's Flock 2018 ""The Penrose Triangle"" shows how this problem has been discussed and worked through for a number of years now.


((WN))  How has CentOS evolved after Red Hat acquired it?  How has it evolved since IBM acquired Red Hat last year?


((Rich Bowen))  The biggest change when CentOS came to Red Hat was that individuals who were working on CentOS in their weekends and evenings now had the ability to devote more time to it.


In addition, the project for the first time was able to put significant resources on helping make the platform useful for open source software development of other projects in Red Hat's ecosystem.  This included the expansion of the SIG program [Special Interest Groups] to include layered projects like Gluster, and OpenStack.


IBM is not involved in the CentOS community or Red Hat's work in it.  An unfortunate misconception about this announcement has been conspiracy theories about IBM's involvement in this decision.  Red Hat operates independently from IBM, and IBM had no influence or involvement in the decision.


((WN))  What are the similarities between CentOS, Fedora and RHEL?


((Pablo Greco))  I'm gonna explain in a really loose way, ok?  Fedora is where everything starts, all the fast moving packages.  Some maintained by Red Hat employees, some by contributors.  Every few years, Red Hat gets sort of a snapshot of Fedora, and starts stabilizing and improving it, and that becomes RHEL.  CentOS originally was a rebuild of that.


About 1 year ago, Stream was introduced, as a way to make the work around RHEL more public, allowing the users to contribute.  Making it sort of a continuous preview of what's to come for RHEL.  That doesn't imply anything about it being of lower quality by definition, or some continuous beta like some people call it.  Many of the packages that are built for stream, reach the next version of RHEL unmodified.  So even if there is a higher level of testing in Stream, it is far from a traditional beta.


((Rich Bowen))  They are each Linux distribution projects, which work on a common code base at different points in its life.  It's born in an upstream open source project, and travels through each of the projects as it matures.


From a community perspective, the projects are each run as open, collaborative communities, but with different audiences.  By the time we get to RHEL, it's done inside Red Hat, but that team also operates with the principles of open source.


The exciting thing about CentOS Stream is that it makes RHEL development more open, both in terms of decision making, and in who can participate.  We're believers in the Four Opens, as the OpenStack community talks about them here — https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/opens.html


Our roots are in open source, but that's not enough without the other three.


((WN))  What are the similarities and differences between CentOS and CentOS Stream?  Or do they just share the name and are completely different?


((Pablo Greco))  For me, Stream is not CentOS, Stream is the next RHEL, the rest is just branding.


((Rich Bowen))  The name ""CentOS"" is frequently misused, and has been for a long time, so here are the basics: CentOS is the project.  CentOS Linux is a rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).  CentOS Stream is an upstream distribution from RHEL, which reflects what the RHEL team intend to put into the next minor release of RHEL.  The CentOS Project also contains other things, such as the SIGs (Special Interest Groups), the Promo/Events team, the CI/CD and build system (CBS) project, and so on.


((WN))  Do you have any stats for the userbase of CentOS vs Stream?


((Pablo Greco))  I don't, but Stream is rather new so I don't expect the number to be that big.  I've been using Stream for most of my things ever since it came out, and I love the idea for it.  The only problem is that Stream is being used as an excuse to kill CentOS, and that's the part I hate.


((Rich Bowen))  We don't.  For reasons of privacy, we have never kept server logs around CentOS Linux, and other CentOS Project ""downloads.""  And these files are served by a large mirror network distributed around the world, much of which we don't have any actual access to.


I put the word downloads in quotes, because installing a Linux distribution isn't exactly just downloading something.  It's composed of thousands of packages which are (can be) installed independently, and figuring out which of those packages are going to CentOS Stream machines, vs CentOS Linux machines (vs Oracle Linux machines, and so on) and which ones are being mirrored for further use by additional users behind a firewall, is a lot of guesswork.


We have some general ideas, but have always been reluctant to try to put actual numbers on it, because of these reasons and others.  Linux user surveys [...] perhaps have a better handle on this than we do, since we have simply never gathered these stats.


((WN))  Could you briefly explain what Red Hat announced and what it means for the future of CentOS?


((Pablo Greco))  They announced that the CentOS as we all know it, doesn't exist anymore, there's only Stream from now on.  This applies to all releases starting with [CentOS] 8, [CentOS] 7 seems to be unaffected by this.  In my view, CentOS is dead, there is no CentOS anymore, because as I said, I view Stream as a RHEL thing and not a CentOS thing.


((WN))  Could you briefly explain Chris Wright's announcement, and what it means for the future of CentOS?


((Rich Bowen))  The future of CentOS is stronger than ever, as it is now literally in the critical path of RHEL development.  The CentOS Project as a community continues, and in fact the community grows more facets as CentOS Stream provides more ways where the community can engage with Red Hat and each other.  There will be some growing pains as users of CentOS Linux find out and help shape whether CentOS Stream meets their needs.  Communities are built in overcoming challenges together, and there are many challenges ahead in making CentOS Stream right for members of the CentOS community.


A major aspect of this is that in the past, CentOS Linux users could not shape the future of the distro within the project.  From now on, not only developers but end users of all types will be able to shape the future of the distro.  If CentOS Stream does not meet a user's need today, now they can advocate and contribute toward it meeting their needs as it evolves.


((WN))  Did Red Hat speak with the CentOS core developer team about this plan?


((Pablo Greco))  I don't have a contractual relation with Red Hat, just as many of the people that helped in the CentOS-QA team.  I assume that those who are knew about this, but the rest of us didn't.  But this is all my assumption, don't have any evidence one way or the other.


((WN))  Did Red Hat speak with the CentOS core developer team about this plan?  Were there any oppositions within Red Hat about this decision?  Was it put to vote?


((Rich Bowen))  Red Hat discussed this with the CentOS Governing Board, which is responsible for the oversight of the CentOS Project.  There was a lot of back-and-forth on that proposal.  The CentOS Governing Board voted and reached consensus.


Red Hat's engineering resource focus has never been decided by voting.  Some of the core developers are on the Governing Board but not everyone in our community was involved in the decision.  As I'll touch on later in this interview, that's one of the reasons that some of the community have taken this change so hard.


Is every Red Hatter happy with the announcement?  Of course not.  A big part of Red Hat's culture is the ability to voice an opinion and ask hard questions.  And Red Hatters have definitely expressed their thoughts about this.


((WN))  Do you know why this sudden move from Red Hat?


((Pablo Greco))  No idea, I can assume it was a business decision, but no information whatsoever.


((Rich Bowen))  CentOS Stream was introduced in September 2019, so while the news may have come as a surprise to many, Red Hat has also had that time to get feedback on CentOS Stream and see momentum that reinforced the role it believed CentOS Stream could fit in the RHEL ecosystem.  I've seen Red Hat's VP of Linux Engineering explain the timing internally — once Red Hat took the decision to the CentOS Governing Board and the Board had voted, they all thought it was important and most transparent for the community leadership to communicate that decision as soon as possible. 


((WN))  Why has the End of Life [EOL] been shortened?


((Pablo Greco))  Good question, I don't have an answer for it.  I guess someone from Red Hat should give you that.  I'm not happy about it to say the least.


((WN))  Why has the EOL been shortened?  Is this unusual?


((Rich Bowen))  First, it's important to understand that the dates that the CentOS project lists as EOL (End Of Life) dates are, and always have been, dependent on Red Hat.  That is, we can say that CentOS Linux 7 will be EOL on a particular date, but if the dates around RHEL 7 shift, hypothetically speaking, then so will those around CentOS Linux 7.  That's what happened with CentOS Linux 8.  This decision was made by Red Hat and the CentOS Board. 


((WN))  What are some of the reasons people consider CentOS for their daily driver or for their servers?


((Pablo Greco))  It used to be rock solid distribution, with almost everything that RHEL has, but without all the hassle or the costs of a RHEL license, and obviously without the main benefit of RHEL which is the support.  CentOS 7 still fits that description.


((Rich Bowen))  Besides the obvious cost benefits of running CentOS Linux, many users find that the friction of running CentOS Linux is much lower than other options.  There's no web form, registration, or subscription management.  And while these frictions are things that the RHEL subscription team is actively working on, this remains part of our users' mindset.


((WN))  How different are CentOS 7 and CentOS 8?


((Rich Bowen))  Upgrades between major release versions provide a chance to provide the latest versions of packages to our users.  A major release will stay on these base package versions for the releases' lifecycle.  The ""rebasing"" of packages allows us to incorporate all of the fixes and enhancements that have occurred between major releases and ensure we maintain the balance of upstream momentum, with the stability that backporting patches and fixes provides.


((Pablo Greco))  In some ways, very different, Modularity may be the biggest, many new versions of things (there was a 5 year gap between 7 and 8).  But for the most part, usage is the same as it has been forever, like in things like repos [repositories], installing and removing packages, building packages, etc.


((WN))  Would it be feasible for the developers to fork CentOS 8 after EOL, to continue developing the OS?


((Rich Bowen))  We've actually covered this in the FAQ that we published on Tuesday.  The short answer is yes, and we fully expect that to happen.  Indeed, the Rocky Linux project has already indicated their intention to do just that. 


There's also ongoing discussion on the CentOS Project mailing lists of how this could be done within the community itself.


((Pablo Greco))  Very, to me the most difficult part of coming up with a new fork is the human factor.  The technical side may have its complications (many to mention), but at the end of the day, they are solvable.


((WN))  Will Red Hat employees be barred from contributing to any community-driven development of forks of CentOS?


((Rich Bowen))  A large part of Red Hat's culture is ingrained in the idea of open source and community.  Red Hat will never prevent its employees from pursuing upstream development and open source projects. 


I think section 6 [of Red Hat's Open source participation guidelines] ""Contributing to upstream projects not maintained by Red Hat"" applies here. 


((WN))  What are the implications of this move for the userbase?


((Pablo Greco))  Where to start?  There are too many cases in the userbase to mention, but taking some examples.  If you have a fast deploying platform (like the Facebook example given in the press release), and you take advantage of the benefit of Stream even with the shortened EOL, this may not even affect you.  But in my opinion, this is not the majority.  Most users wanted CentOS for its premise of being bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL, and since that option doesn't exist anymore, until a suitable replacement appears, things are going to be complicated.  I guess I could extend this by a lot, but that's the gist.


Depending on your use case, you may be unaffected, or have a really complicated year ahead of you. I think very few people will be unaffected.


((WN))  Is the success of Stream somehow responsible for this move?


((Pablo Greco))  In my opinion, no.  The need for Stream to succeed maybe, but I just don't see Stream succeeding under the new conditions.


((WN))  Is the success of CentOS Stream somehow responsible for this? In the announcement, Wright said Stream was not the replacement for CentOS. What is the possible solution for those who relied on CentOS? 


((Rich Bowen))  CentOS Stream is not a drop-in replacement for all existing use cases.  It requires sysadmins out there to evaluate the new information and adjust their workflows.  We would do our user base a disservice to claim otherwise.  For many use cases it can be used as a replacement.  Indeed, for people who wanted the stability of the CentOS Linux base operating system, but were frustrated by the slowness of application updates, CentOS Stream will be a better replacement for CentOS Linux — now those updates will be available sooner, should users choose to update.


We also want people to understand the difference, so they can see the additional options it brings to them.  We want people to go into this decision with eyes open, and not expect it to be something that it's not.


((WN))  What can be done for those users for whom CentOS Stream does not meet their requirements?


((Pablo Greco))  Pay for RHEL, move to another distribution, or wait for someone to fill in the gap.  If someone has another solution, I'm all ears.


((Rich Bowen))  We hope any users who are in that situation will tell us, so we can figure out how to fix that failing.  One of the exciting things about the move to CentOS Stream is it's designed to be an actual contributor community, rather than the legacy CentOS Linux that is almost entirely a consumer community.


CentOS Stream is more than just something you download and install.  It's a process and a community — a venue for contributing changes, making suggestions, and reporting bugs.  All of that feeds back into making CentOS Stream better, and, in turn, making RHEL better.


That said, Red Hat is working on some ""low- or no-cost programs"" for users who cannot, for whatever reason, deploy CentOS Stream in their environment. This is discussed in the Red Hat announcement and we anticipate hearing more details around that in the coming weeks. 


((WN))  What are some of the best arguments in favour of, and against this move that you are aware of?


((Pablo Greco))  I have nothing positive to say about the announcement, let's just leave it at that.  [About against the move,] I can't put it into words you can publish.


((Rich Bowen))  While I empathize with users' response to the decision, I believe that shifting focus to CentOS Stream is the right solution for our community, in the longer term.


CentOS Stream creates a place where the community can actually participate in the development of the OS on which they rely.  They can now actually file bugs against it and have those considered by the engineering team.  They can submit their own changes to the project and expect that they will actually be considered and accepted into the code.


The arguments against it have been made eloquently elsewhere, and if I can summarize them, they would be timing (dropping the announcement right on the heels of the CentOS 6 Linux EOL) and timing (cutting the maintenance lifetime of CentOS Linux 8 from 10 years to 2).


((WN))  How will this move affect the development of RHEL, and other GNU/Linux?


((Rich Bowen))  RHEL maintainers try to do as much work as possible ""upstream first"". This means starting in upstream open source projects like the kernel, then participating in Fedora, then bringing those changes in for RHEL.  CentOS Stream gives RHEL maintainers a place to collaborate with the community in public on what's coming for the next minor release. 


((Pablo Greco))  I don't think this will affect other distros in a negative way, quite the contrary.  With respect to RHEL development, depends on how much people contribute to Stream.  If people contribute to it, it will make RHEL a better product, because it will have a broader testing in the earlier stages.  But that's just the benefit of stream.  I mean, this was still true before the announcement.


((WN))  Will the maintainers appoint some new maintainers (not necessarily Red Hat employees) to see some development?  Can the current maintainers continue to work on CentOS in their spare time?


((Pablo Greco))  As far as I understand, no.  CentOS is a trademark of Red Hat, so anything would have to be done on the outside.  But I'm not a lawyer, and I think you should get a formal answer to that from someone who represents Red Hat.


((WN))  What does the strong reaction from the CentOS community indicate?


((Pablo Greco))  For me it indicates that Red Hat didn't expect this, or that they did expect it and were prepared to handle it.  I don't like any of the options.


((WN))  What is the reason for such a strong reaction from the CentOS community?  Had Red Hat considered this while making this move?  How are they planning to handle it?


((Rich Bowen))  Open source communities are often very passionate about their projects.  The very nature of open source means that each person has equal ownership of the project.  So the strong reaction here is understandable.  A decision was made outside of their view, which they would not have made themselves.  That makes people feel betrayed.  We get that.


And, yes, we discussed, in the leadup to this, how it would affect people, and that they would be angry.  We tried to minimize that, but we understand community skepticism about that statement.  It's a big change, being made quickly, and driven by business needs that the majority of our user community doesn't know or particularly care about.


I've talked in other places about the stages of grief.  The community has lost something, and they are grieving that.  Part of that process is anger.  This is neither unexpected nor strange in any way.


We also understand that this explanation rings hollow to some, and sounds like, ""We considered that and then decided to ignore it.""  That's not the case, but we understand why some people feel that it is.


How are we planning to handle it?  By ensuring that CentOS Stream lives up to our promises by doing rather than talking.  I'm here, as the community manager, to help people find the solutions that they need, and to help them navigate this period of transition. 


((WN))  How many core developers are there, who are not working for Red Hat?


((Pablo Greco))  The CentOS QA team which handles most of the day-to-day things, are about 20 people, most of which are not Red Hat employees, like myself.


((WN))  How do you think Fedora now fits in the grand scheme of Red Hat development?


((Pablo Greco))  Fedora is still the upstream for whatever comes to RHEL, and is where most of the big changes happen.  So in my opinion, Red Hat needs a stable and vibrant Fedora.


((WN))  Many users are calling it ""The death of CentOS"".  Do you agree with that?  Will the maintainers appoint some new maintainers (not necessarily Red Hat employees) to see some development?  Can the current maintainers continue to work on CentOS in their spare time?


((Rich Bowen))  No, obviously I do not agree that this is the death of CentOS.  As I said earlier, CentOS is a project with multiple outputs, and the remaining outputs are still important both to CentOS users and to Red Hat.  The project continues, it just looks different now, with a different primary focus.


That said, we totally understand community members who feel that we have killed the part of the project that they care about, and that, to them, this means the death of the project.  That's not confusing or surprising at all.


In the coming year, we hope to demonstrate that CentOS Stream is every bit as useful, to most of our users, as CentOS Linux was.  And for the users for whom it is not as useful, we will strive to understand why, and whether we can address that gap.


The very first sentence of my blog post on Tuesday was ""The future of the CentOS Project is CentOS Stream.""  Clearly that implies that I don't believe that this is the end of the line, or the death of the project.  Our job going forward is to demonstrate the value of CentOS Stream, and build the contributor community around it.


((WN))  How can an open source project ensure situations like these do not repeat?


((Pablo Greco))  Wish I knew, maybe not letting for-profit companies dictate the future of non-profit organizations/distributions.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'm equipped to solve that :(


((Rich Bowen))  All projects in the open source ecosystem are unique and face unique challenges.  We would not presume to try to predict how to anticipate another project's issues.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Conservative_groups_hold_rally_in_Washington_D.C._claiming_U.S._elections_were_stolen_from_President_Trump,2020-12-15,Conservative groups hold rally in Washington D.C. claiming U.S. elections were stolen from President Trump,"Several conservative groups claiming the 2020 U.S. presidential election was stolen from incumbent President Donald Trump gathered on Saturday in the U.S. capital, Washington D.C., for a rally organized by Women for America First.  Reportedly several thousand supporters turned out, with Trump flags and hats, in D.C. to protest, some in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, which rejected, the day before the rally, a lawsuit filed by Texas which tried to overturn the results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.


Trump tweeted he wasn't aware of the event but would go to see it anyway: ""Wow!  Thousands of people forming in Washington (D.C.) for Stop the Steal.  Didn't know about this, but I'll be seeing them! #MAGA""  MAGA stands for Make America Great Again — a slogan commonly used by Trump and his supporters.


Trump flew above the rally on his Marine One helicopter on his way to West Point, New York, with supporters cheering below. Former Trump adviser and retired general Michael Flynn was on stage while Trump flew over.  This was the first time Flynn made a public speech since he was pardoned by Trump.  He said ""That's pretty cool.  Imagine just being able to jump in a helicopter and just go for a joy ride around Washington"".  Another former Trump adviser, Sebastian Gorka, also spoke in the rally and encouraged supporters to remain hopeful after the recent court decision.


The rallies happened two days before the formal vote of the Electoral College to choose the president-elect.  Trump and his supporters claimed Joe Biden only won the elections due to voter fraud and sought to overturn the results.  Organizers of the rally said they were fighting corruption and dishonesty.  Flynn said there was a lack of transparency in the elections and urged the crowd to consider what the counters are hiding from them and why don't they let them look at the signatures and at the machines.


A couple from Florida, Richard and Lisa Parry, made a 14-hour drive to D.C. for the rally.  Lisa Parry, a retired nurse, said, ""I went to bed at 1 o'clock and Trump was ahead.  There's no way[...] I don't believe it, it's fake.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Gregory_Kurtzer_discusses_plans_for_Rocky_Linux_with_Wikinews_as_Red_Hat_announces_moving_focus_away_from_CentOS,2020-12-18,Gregory Kurtzer discusses plans for Rocky Linux with Wikinews as Red Hat announces moving focus away from CentOS,"Last week, on December 8, US-based software company Red Hat announced plans to shift their focus away from CentOS in favour of CentOS stream.


Started in 2004, CentOS has been a free-of-cost free/libre open source software which provided binary-code compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) — Red Hat's GNU General Public Licensed paid operating system.  Gregory Kurtzer told Wikinews he started CAOS Linux around the time when Red Hat announced End of Life for their Red Hat Linux in favour of subscription-based Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  CAOS was succeeded by CentOS when Rocky McGaugh, a developer of CAOS rebuilt the source code of RHEL to provide a monetarily free alternative.  CentOS was absorbed into Red Hat in 2014, with Red Hat gaining the trademark rights of ""CentOS"".


Red Hat also sponsors the development of the Fedora operating system.  Until now, software development took place on Fedora, which was later adopted in RHEL, which the Red Hat maintained and provided support for, for those customers who had RHEL subscription. CentOS would then follow RHEL's release cycle to provide the same features free of cost, but without the support.


Stream was announced in September 2019, just two months after Red Hat was acquired by IBM.  CentOS Stream's development cycle had new features added to it before the features became a part of RHEL.  Stream receives more frequent updates, however, it does not follow RHEL's release cycle. 


With CentOS Stream, developments from the community and the Red Hat employees would take place beforehand on both Fedora, and Stream as a rolling release, before those features are absorbed into RHEL.  CentOS followed the release cycle of RHEL and therefore it was a stable distribution.  Features available in CentOS were tried and tested by Fedora, and then RHEL maintainers.


Red Hat's Chief Technical Officer Chris Wright wrote in the announcement ""CentOS Stream isn't a replacement for CentOS Linux; rather, it's a natural, inevitable next step intended to fulfill the project's goal of furthering enterprise Linux innovation.""  Since the announcement was made, many people expressed their anger on Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Reddit and CentOS project's mailing list. CentOS 8's End of Life (EOL) has been moved up from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, while CentOS 7 is expected to receive maintenance updates through June 2024, outliving CentOS 8.


Soon after Red Hat's announcement, Kurtzer announced his intentions to develop Rocky Linux, to fill the role CentOS had been playing for so long.  Kurtzer said Rocky Linux was named after Rocky McGaugh.  ""Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh. He is no longer with us, so as a H/T [hat tip] to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you...Rocky Linux"", Kurtzer wrote.  Wikinews discussed with Kurtzer the beginning of CentOS, and future of Rocky Linux.


While no formal date of release has been announced for Rocky Linux, Kurtzer said they are planning to release the CentOS replacement before the end of life of CentOS 8.  Kurtzer also said Rocky Linux will run on both x86-64 and ARM-based processors, and CentOS users would be able to convert their OS to Rocky Linux just by running a single command.


Saying Rocky Linux is for the community, Kurtzer said he ""take[s] the responsibility of ensuring that all decisions are in favor of the community and the project and free from corporate control"" including his own company.  Talking about the attention from the userbase Rocky Linux has received, Kurtzer said, ""I have never seen an open community come together this fast and be this passionate about working together towards a common goal.""


Why was CentOS originally created?  What were the reasons why it was then absorbed by Red Hat?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  CentOS was originally created because Red Hat decided to EOL (End of Life) Red Hat Linux (RHL) shortly after releasing RHL 8.  Overnight, RHL ceased to exist and Red Hat instead released Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) which was a commercial only product.  This means that the majority of RHL users were left without a ""free"" solution or upgrade path.


At the time a Linux distribution that I founded called CAOS Linux was just beginning to get underway, and we too were relying on RHL as a bootstrap build environment.  One of our developers, Rocky McGaugh, quickly rebuilt the sources in RHEL to give us a stable foundation.  That was the beginning of CentOS which was released as an open source project.


After CentOS became widely known, CentOS was separated from Caos Linux Foundation and another person took the lead.  Later, the project underwent some drama — lost developers, contributors, and a lot of support, to the point where only a couple of developers were running everything and Red Hat hired most of them.  I had no visibility of the acquisition of CentOS.


((WN))  How has CentOS evolved since it became a part of Red Hat?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  Red Hat has invested a good deal of resources into the CentOS project itself and the community has benefited from additional developers, closer ties to Red Hat's internal development team and infrastructure (including Fedora), marketing, branding, conference presence, etc.


Red Hat has always been a tremendous supporter of Linux and open source, but that doesn't make Red Hat/IBM a good home for CentOS.


((WN))  How will this move by Red Hat, to move focus towards Stream, affect those who relied on CentOS?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  The focus towards Stream, while not exactly meeting the needs of enterprise use cases, wasn't the biggest problem, it was the unexpected change in the CentOS End Of Life (EOL) which moved from 2029 to 2021.  But either one, much less both together, demonstrates that the Community Enterprise Operating System is not technically ""community"" or ""enterprise"".  We have heard from many people now that this move has undermined not only trust in CentOS, but also other open source distributions of Linux which are commercially controlled.  Who is to stop them from doing something very similar?


((WN))  Tell us about Rocky Linux.


((Gregory Kurtzer))  Rocky Linux is a Community Enterprise Linux distribution by the community and for the community.  Our goal is to be bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL and provide a long life for enterprise needs.


((WN))  How will Rocky Linux aim to fill the void that CentOS will leave?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  The last time I checked, CentOS was the most utilized Linux server operating system on the Internet.  All of these users, including development teams, need stability.  Linux is free.  Myself, among many thousands of developers and companies around the world, have contributed to what makes up a Linux distribution.  While nobody has a problem with companies offering value by building a usable, supportable platform out of open source software, there needs to be a freely available version out of respect to all of the people who have made the distribution possible as well as the organizations that have contributed time and resources into Linux.  It is not owned by the Linux distribution vendor, it is packaged by them.


Rocky [Linux] will provide a freely available, stable, enterprise-grade operating system that can be used everywhere by anyone.


((WN))  Will Rocky Linux provide a way to migrate CentOS 7 and 8 to Rocky Linux?  How will you ensure it is a smooth transition?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  We are not currently forking CentOS 7 because that has not changed its EOL.  If that changes, we will rebuild that as well.


To convert a CentOS 8 system to Rocky Linux 8, you only need to run a single command:


dnf install http://your.favorite.rocky.mirror/path/to/rocky-release*.rpm


Because Rocky is completely compatible with both CentOS and RHEL, this single command is all you will have to do to keep your system running, patched, and supported.


((WN))  Which hardwares will Rocky Linux run on?  Is the aim to provide support for all hardwares CentOS supported, or just those which Red Hat supported?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  So far we have very active support and interest in x86-64 as well as ARM.  Nobody from IBM Power has reached out to us (yet).


((WN))  Will Rocky Linux be the same as CentOS in functionality, or will it do some things differently?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  Bug-for-bug compatibility.


We've already been approached by multiple people asking about Special Interest Groups (SIGs) for value adds over and above the base enterprise platform.  One of my interests, for example, can be supported here with an HPC (High Performance Computing) SIG.  Big Data, Kubernetes/Containers, and enhanced security have been among the other SIG proposals we've received.


((WN))  What are some of the challenges that Rocky Linux currently faces?  How do you plan to tackle those?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  Velocity of growth is the biggest challenge so far.  We are six days old and we keep hitting the invite link limits for our Slack, which now has thousands of people in it.  I've requested a sponsorship from Slack, but so far, we haven't had a very positive outcome.  We're looking into alternatives to Slack for real-time communications as well.  For durable discussion, we've had more than 100,000 views of our forums in three days, and already we're hitting limits with our hosting there, so that needs to be scaled soon as well.


Also, we are working on FIPS certifications and STIG standards which have been a consistent request.  That means that the security and compliance team is guiding how every aspect of the infrastructure is set up to guarantee security, compliance, and trust.


((WN))  How many developers are working on Rocky Linux?  What are the important things that require significant developer time and attention?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  We are about 65 contributors actively driving Rocky right now, all in small task groups to do specific things.  We also have about another 250 who have volunteered and are awaiting roles, and even more asking to help drive and build the community.  We also have small to massive corporations stepping up to support us in the form of sponsorships, donations, mirrors, hardware, cloud resources, etc.


Very careful attention will be paid to the security, trust, and compliance of what we are creating.


I have never seen an open community come together this fast and be this passionate about working together towards a common goal.


((WN))  Can we expect Rocky Linux to be released before CentOS 8 reaches end of life?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  Yes.  While we haven't given any ETA on release, we already have a large percentage of the work underway and if I were to make a SWAG [Scientific wild-ass guess], it will be near the end of Q1 or beginning of Q2 2021.


((WN))  How will the governing body of Rocky Linux function?  How can Rocky Linux ensure similar situation like this does not repeat?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  At the moment, we have a structure similar to most organizations.  People have been empowered to make decisions and report upwards.  This may change in the future, but right now, we need leadership and I take the responsibility of ensuring that all decisions are in favor of the community and the project and free from corporate control (even from my own company).


My commitment to the project is that Rocky will always remain in the best interest of the community and everyone who wishes to be part of the organization, with good intentions, will be welcomed.  Since day one, Rocky's coordination efforts have been completely transparent.  I invite anyone reading this to join the #rocky-coordination channel on our Slack instance. There you'll find many high-level discussions taking place with direct community involvement.


((WN))  What are the short-term and long-term goals of Rocky Linux and how will the project ensure it stays on its path?


((Gregory Kurtzer))  Short term: organization of technology and people.


Mid term: general availability of Rocky Linux.


Long term: growing the community like sponsoring SIGs.

This comes a week after he attended a summit with President of France Emmanuel Macron, who was later diagnosed with the disease and which led to contact tracing across Europe and multiple leaders voluntarily self-isolating. 


European leaders self-isolating from the incident included the Prime Ministers of Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, and France itself, and European Council chief Charles Michel.


Without mentioning any symptoms, 47-year-old Matovič's government office has said he has cancelled all near upcoming events, and self-quarantine announcements quickly followed by government ministers who attended an official meeting with the Prime Minister two days earlier. During that meeting, it was agreed a partial lockdown would be instated on Saturday in response to increasing number of infections amongst the nation's 5.5 million people.


Council spokesperson Barend Leyts, when asked whether an investigation was conducted to see who else at the summit may have caught COVID-19, told Brussels-based media network EURACTIV safety procedure had been followed and only Macron and Matovič were known to have tested positive.


After Deputy Prime Minister for Finance and Minister of Economy Richard Sulík failed to procure sufficient numbers of rapid testing kits, the Prime Minister apologised to the people of his country for ""having an idiot as economy minister.""

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/%27Earth-based_life_can_survive_in_hydrogen-rich_atmospheres%27:_MIT_professor_Dr_Seager_tells_Wikinews_about_her_research_on_organisms_thriving_in_oxygen-less_environment,2020-12-25,'Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres': MIT professor Dr Seager tells Wikinews about her research on organisms thriving in oxygen-less environment,"Friday, December 25, 2020 
In May, a study was published in journal Nature Astronomy, conducted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Dr Sara Seager and other researchers, showing single-celled organisms like Escherichia coli (E. coli) and yeast can thrive in both 100% hydrogen gas and helium atmospheres.  Wikinews discussed the findings with Dr Seager to know more about her research.


Life has not been observed in any habitat other than Earth, which has an oxygen-rich environment.  While Earth's atmosphere is dominated by nitrogen gas, oxygen is essential for advanced living organisms.  Some species of microorganisms do not require oxygen for metabolism, called anærobic organisms, such as methanogens which rely on carbon-dioxide while releasing methane.


Researchers used Escherichia coli strain K-12 and Saccharomyces cerevisiæ strain S288C for this experiment.  The two microorganisms were kept in four different environments: one being 100% air, and the other three being anærobic environments: 100% H2, 100% He, and 80%-20% N2-CO2.  The environments were kept in at 28° Celsius.  The researchers made sure the anaerobic experiment environments were anoxic, and had installed oxygen sensors to report fluctuation in the oxygen level.  They monitored growth of E. coli using optical density measurement, and they used a hæmocytometer for yeast.


The study reported the organisms were reproducing normally in both 100% H2 and 100% He environment.  However, the sigmoid-shaped growth curve was not on par with 100% air.  E. coli and yeast switch from ærobic respiration, which uses oxygen, to anærobic respiration and fermentation.  Both processes are less efficient and do not produce as much energy as ærobic respiration.


E. coli in an 80%-20% N2-CO2 environment had slower growth rate as CO2 dissolves and makes the liquid medium acidic.  Such reduction in growth rate was not observed for yeast cultures, which can thrive in acidic environments.  However, yeast's growth rate in 100% air was far greater than in the other three media.  The likely reason for this significant difference was lack of oxygen for non-respiratory purposes, the research reported.  Oxygen is essential for synthesis of biochemicals such as heme and sterols, which are important for yeast.  In atmospheres lacking oxygen to produce these chemicals, yeast fungi have stunted growth rate.


With this discovery, Dr Seager said scientists can now observe even more planets to study for habitable life.


""There's a diversity of habitable worlds out there, and we have confirmed that Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres.  We should definitely add those kinds of planets to the menu of options when thinking of life on other worlds, and actually trying to find it"", Professor Seager said.


A rocky planet with expanded hydrogen-rich atmosphere should be easy to detect using the emerging technologies.  Hydrogen and helium gas have very low density.  Dr Seager said, ""It's kind of hard to get your head around, but that light gas just makes the atmosphere more expansive [...] And for telescopes, the bigger the atmosphere is compared to the backdrop of a planet's star, the easier it is to detect.""


The research paper noted rocky planets which have radius below 1.7 times Earth's radius (Earth's radius is roughly 6360 km) can support a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, if water were to react with Iron.


The research paper reported E. coli releases a number of gases when it lives in hydrogen-based atmosphere including ammonia, methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, carbonyl sulfide, carbonyl disulfide and nitrous oxide.  These gases can serve as biosignature gases which can help astronomers detect and study potential life on exoplanets.


Confirming life can thrive in atmospheres that do not have oxygen, Seager said ""Astronomers should keep an open mind as to which planets are worth searching for life"".


With NASA's James Webb Telescope scheduled to be deployed next year, the paper suggests researchers could observe smaller exoplanets that orbit small red-dwarf stars.


What prompted your interest in studying the survival of single-celled organisms in hydrogen gas environments?


((Sara Seager))  We wanted to show to astronomers that life can [survive] in hydrogen gas environments because planet atmospheres dominated by hydrogen are the easiest to study with current techniques (as opposed to N2 or CO2-dominated atmospheres).


((WN))  What led you to conduct this research?


((Sara Seager))  It's one of my life's goals to find signs of life on exoplanets.  We'd hate to have missed something just because we were too narrow minded.


When I and others write proposals to use the upcoming telescopes (including the James Webb Space Telescope and the extremely large telescopes now under construction: ELT, TMT, GMT) we want to be able to point to evidence that hydrogen atmospheres shouldn't kill or destroy life.


((WN))  When did the team start working on this study?


((Sara Seager))  About three years ago.  However we started working in earnest about 2 years ago.


((WN))  Could you explain — in very simple terms — what you've done and what you saw?


((Sara Seager))  We grew microorganisms E. coli (a 'Prokaryote') and yeast (a more complex 'Eukaryote') in atmospheres other than air, including molecular hydrogen (and also helium and a carbon dioxide/nitrogen mixture).  We saw that life could grow and thrive in these other atmosphere types.  Although, the microbes grew more slowly than they would in air, i.e.  with oxygen.


((WN))  What activities did this study involve?


((Sara Seager))  Custom-made sealed bottles with E. coli and yeast growing in them.


((WN))  Which activity took the most time and attention?


((Sara Seager))  The custom equipment was the most time consuming.


((WN))  Were there any challenges the team faced while conducting this experiment?


((Sara Seager))  Hydrogen gas is considered unsafe in large quantities.  Although we only used small amounts there were safety regulations that made our work challenging.


((WN))  What is the most fascinating aspect of this discovery?  How is it going to affect future space exploration?


((Sara Seager))  That E. coli, a simple single-celled organism, can produce so many different gases.  Proving to the astronomy community that life can survive and thrive in a hydrogen-dominated environment will enable astronomers to jump-start the search for life because hydrogen-dominated planet atmospheres are easiest to study.


((WN))  Were you surprised by the results?


((Sara Seager))  No, and the biologists on my team and elsewhere are not surprised either.  Hydrogen is not known to be toxic to life.  And, the life was not gaining energy from the atmosphere but rather from the ""broth"", the liquid culture the microbes were living in.


One thing I was personally surprised about is the diversity of gases produced by E. coli; this lowly life form can give us scientific hope that a range of interesting gases might also be produced by simple microbial-type life on exoplanets. 


((WN))  How would you define what a 'biosignature gas' is and what is its advantage in looking for life in exoplanets compared to other forms[?]


((Sara Seager))  A ""biosignature gas"" is one that is produced by life, can accumulate in a planetary atmosphere, and be detected with remote space telescopes.  It is a ""sign"" of life, not foolproof evidence of life.


Exoplanets are so so so far away.  We can barely study their atmospheres at all.  Looking for gases that don't belong in a given atmosphere is the main way we can hope to search for signs of life beyond our solar system.


An example is oxygen on Earth.  Oxygen (O2) fills our atmosphere to 20% by volume.  Without plants and photosynthetic bacteria, there would be no oxygen.  If there is an alien civilization with the kind of telescopes we are hoping to build, and they can see oxygen in our atmosphere, they will know oxygen is a highly reactive gas and shouldn't be present.  The aliens might infer there is life producing the oxygen.


The alternative is SETI — search for extra terrestrial signatures by way of mostly radio signals.  That requires intelligent life intentionally sending us a signal.  In the search for biosignature gases we can rely on simple single-celled life.


((WN))  Did your team also investigate the growth pattern of the bacteria in other biosignature gases?


((Sara Seager))  No.


((WN))  There are a few microbes on Earth known to thrive in hydrogen-rich environments.  Why did you decide to investigate yeast and E. coli for this experiment?


((Sara Seager))  Hydrogen-rich environments on Earth are incredibly rare and not well known.  We decided to do a simple experiment to communicate clearly to astronomers that live can survive and thrive in hydrogen environments.


((WN))  If there are planets with hydrogen-dominant atmosphere which can host life — will they have ultra-violet protection layer like the ozone gas?  If not, how will it affect the evolution of the life of these single-celled bacteria?


((Sara Seager))   No.  The organisms may have to develop UV resistance like some life on Earth has.


((WN))  In the experiment, the study reported yeast had ""a substantially lower maximal cell concentration in the pure hydrogen-gas environment"".  What could be the reason for that?


((Sara Seager))  Even though life can survive without oxygen, life reproduces more with oxygen.


((WN))  The research paper talks about systems with hydrogen gas in abundance in the atmosphere.  Do you suspect microorganisms might be living in some of those systems?


((Sara Seager))  On Earth, yes, in niches.


((WN))  Are there habitats on Earth that might hint at what life on a hydrogen-rich atmosphere planet might look like?


((Sara Seager))  Not really.


((WN))  Should this change our search for life on other planets?  If so, how?


((Sara Seager))  This should open up — continue to push — astronomers on what kinds of planets might be habitable.  We will have so few planets to search for life around, even with our upcoming sophisticated telescopes, that we want to keep options open.


((WN))  What are some of the ways to detect microscopic alien life on an exoplanet?  Or is it beyond the limitations of physical instruments?


((Sara Seager))  Currently beyond limitation.  Future telescopes will be able to search for gases that might be linked to microbes.


((WN))  Are there any candidate exoplanets or satellites which meet the above description to be potential hosts for life?


((Sara Seager))  There is a list, but we do not know enough about the exoplanets, we need more information.


((WN))  Are some categories of exoplanets more likely to support hydrogen-based lifeforms?


((Sara Seager))  Super Earths.  We know hot Jupiters and giant exoplanets have hydrogen/helium atmospheres but they are too hot beneath the atmospheres for life to survive.


((WN))  Can you describe the kind of planet that would likely have such an atmosphere?


((Sara Seager))  Planets are born with hydrogen in their atmospheres; even Earth had a tiny amount in its atmosphere.  Past calculations (that is theory, not observation) show the scenarios under which a planet can have a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere.  It can outgas if it is made of building blocks that have H-containing minerals.  Or some planets can capture an H/He from the planetary nebula while the planet is forming, then even if they lose some H and He it might be maintained from outgassing from the interior.


((WN))  How massive do the exoplanets have to be, so there is enough atmosphere available to support hydrogen-based life?  I suspect below a threshold, the planet's gravitational pull might be too weak, the planet may lose its atmosphere.


((Sara Seager))  Correct.  We know very little about exoplanet atmospheres; forthcoming observations are needed to learn more.


((WN))  Will the yeast and E. coli survive in a very thin atmosphere or in vacuum?


((Sara Seager))  Probably not.


((WN))  Does E. coli or yeast consume hydrogen gas for their survival?


((Sara Seager))  No.


((WN))  How many hydrogen gas-dominant exoplanets or satellites have been discovered?  How common are they?


((Sara Seager))  Rocky planets with hydrogen-gas dominated atmospheres haven't been discovered yet because we can't yet observe and study rocky planet atmospheres.


((WN))  Can we predict the category of the host stars where the planets may support life?


((Sara Seager))  We cannot.


((WN))  What are some of the adverse effects of living in a high concentration of hydrogen gas for E. coli and yeast?


((Sara Seager))  To my knowledge, none.


((WN))  How did you ensure the gas concentration remained stable throughout the experiment?


((Sara Seager))  Sealed bottles.


((WN))  Were [the microbes] taken out of the bottles for [counting]?


((Sara Seager))  Yes, with a needle so that air would not enter the bottles.


((WN))  The growth curve of 100% helium and 100% hydrogen gas environments were nearly the same.  What does that suggest?


((Sara Seager))  That the life we studied can probably survive in any type of non-poisonous atmosphere if it has energy, nutrients, and liquid. 


((WN))  What's the significance of learning that microorganisms can survive and grow in a 100% hydrogen atmosphere?


((Sara Seager))  We used a pure 100% hydrogen atmosphere as a proxy for a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere (as atmosphere[s] are unlikely to be pure anything). 


The significance is for astronomers.  In our further search for life on exoplanets (once the next-generation telescopes are available to us) we will look for signs of life by way of gases in exoplanet atmospheres that might be produced by life. 


Rocky planets with hydrogen atmospheres will be easier to study than atmospheres with nitrogen (N2) or carbon-dioxide atmospheres because hydrogen is a light gas and creates an expansive atmosphere.


I should note that we don't have any rocky planets yet known with hydrogen atmospheres, but they are theorized.  Nor do we have a large number of rocky planets with accessible atmospheres at all.  So this whole sentiment is somewhat in the future.


((WN))  What can we infer from the growth curve of the bacteria in 80% nitrogen gas, 20% carbon dioxide environment?


((Sara Seager))  This atmosphere was used as a control and was not intended to have meaning on its own.


((WN))  How do you think next year's James Webb Telescope will set the course of astrobiology for years to come?


((Sara Seager))  Webb is poised to answer some of your above questions relating to rocky exoplanet atmospheres.  Webb has a small chance to find biosignature gases, but there are really only a small pool of planets available for study.


((WN))  Are there any future plans to follow up on this study?  Perhaps in different physical environments and with different microorganisms?


((Sara Seager))  My team is not planning on follow-up work.


((WN))   What lies ahead in this field of research?


((Sara Seager))  Observations with Webb, and with other telescopes now under construction.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/Chilean_authorities_report_first_COVID-19_outbreak_in_Antarctica,2020-12-26,Chilean authorities report first COVID-19 outbreak in Antarctica,"On Sunday, Chilean military authorities reported 36 infections with COVID-19 at General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme Base in Trinity Peninsula, Antarctica. A first outbreak on the continent, it reportedly followed an outbreak on a naval supply ship that had travelled there. On Thursday officials reported the number of cases in the outbreak rose to 58.


The Health Minister for the Biobio Region in Chile reported on Tuesday, 21 confirmed cases of the virus on Chilean Navy's Sergeant Aldea supply vessel that visited the base between November 27 and December 10. On Thursday the local health secretary reported one more case in Las Estrellas' village, where some Air Force Base civilian personnel live.


The Chilean Armed Forces said on Sunday, the 36 people infected included 26 army personnel. They said the 36 people were moved to Patagonia, the south-most region in Chile in the South America continent, where they were being monitored by local health authorities.


With this outbreak, the Antarctic continent became the last continent to report cases of what the World Health Organization declared a pandemic earlier this year.

https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/US_professional_wrestler_Jon_Huber_dies_aged_41,2020-12-28,US professional wrestler Jon Huber dies aged 41,"US professional wrestler Jon Huber, who performed for WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) under the ring name Luke Harper and for AEW (All Elite Wrestling) under the ring name Brodie Lee, died on Saturday aged 41.


According to his wife, Amanda, Huber succumbed to an unspecified lung disorder, unrelated to COVID-19, for which he received treatment at the Mayo Clinic. At the time of his death, Huber was signed to AEW but had been absent from television tapings since October for reasons not publicized.  The professional wrestling community reacted to the news with grief and shock.


""Heartbroken and numb,"" writes Huber's longtime tag team partner Erick Rowan  on Instagram. ""I have lost not only a friend but a brother!""


In his WWE run from 2012 to 2019, as Luke Harper, Huber, an imposing figure standing six feet five inches tall, aligned with Rowan  as part of The Wyatt Family faction.  He won the promotion's Intercontinental Championship once and the Smackdown Tag Team Championship.  After asking for his release from WWE, Huber signed with AEW around the beginning of this year. In March, he debuted as the heel Brodie Lee, leader of the villainous faction The Dark Order. This past August, he won the promotion's TNT Championship.


""Huber was exceptionally respected and loved in every way"", reads an AEW press release, ""a fierce and captivating talent, a thoughtful mentor and simply a very kind soul that starkly contradicted his persona as Mr. Brodie Lee.  Jon's love for his wife Amanda, and children Brodie and Nolan, was evident to all of us who were fortunate enough to spend time with him"". 


WWE expressed sadness and extended condolences to the family, friends, and fans of Huber. They currently feature a video on their website highlighting Huber's career.
